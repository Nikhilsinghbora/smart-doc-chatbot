      "Scope\n",
      "We have examined the description of the Microsoft 365 Central Services system (“M365”) of Management of Microsoft Corporation (the “Service Organization” or “Microsoft”) for processing user entities’ transactions throughout the period October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, included in Section 3, “Management of Microsoft’s Description of Its Microsoft 365 Central Services System” (the “Description”) and the suitability of the design and the operating effectiveness of controls included in the Description to achieve the related control objectives stated in the Description, based on the criteria identified in management of Microsoft’s assertion.\n",
      "The controls and control objectives included in the Description are those that management of Microsoft believes are likely to be relevant to user entities’ internal control over financial reporting, and the Description does not include those aspects of the M365 Central Services system that are not likely to be relevant to user entities’ internal control over financial reporting.\n",
      "The information in Section 5, “Supplemental Information Provided by Management of Microsoft” is presented by management of Microsoft to provide additional information and is not a part of management of Microsoft’s Description of its M365 Central Services system made available to user entities during the period October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024.\n",
      "Information in Section 5 has not been subjected to the procedures applied in the examination of the Description of the M365 Central Services system and of the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls to achieve the related control objectives stated in the Description of the M365 Central Services system and, accordingly, we express no opinion on it.\n",
      "The Service Organization uses Microsoft Azure (“Azure”) including the Microsoft Datacenters service (“subservice organization”) for its hosting of physical and virtual servers, network management, data protection and storage services.\n",
      "The Description in Section 3 includes only the controls and related control objectives of Microsoft and excludes the control objectives and related controls of the subservice organization.\n",
      "The Description also indicates that certain control objectives specified by Microsoft can be achieved only if complementary subservice organization controls assumed in the design of Microsoft’s controls are suitably designed and operating effectively, along with the related controls at Microsoft.\n",
      "Our examination did not extend to controls of the subservice organization or their functions, and we have not evaluated the suitability of the design or operating effectiveness of such complementary subservice organization controls.\n",
      "The Description indicates that certain control objectives specified in the Description can be achieved only if complementary user entity controls contemplated in the design of Microsoft’s controls are suitably designed and operating effectively, along with related controls at Microsoft.\n",
      "Our examination did not extend to such complementary user entity controls, and we have not evaluated the suitability of the design or operating effectiveness of such complementary user entity controls.\n",
      "Service Organization’s Responsibilities\n",
      "In Section 2, “Management of Microsoft’s Assertion,” management of Microsoft has provided an assertion about the fairness of the presentation of the Description and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of the controls to achieve the related control objectives stated in the Description.\n",
      "Management of Microsoft is responsible for preparing the Description and its assertion, including the completeness, accuracy, and method of presentation of the Description and the assertion, providing the services covered by the Description, specifying the control objectives and stating them in the Description, identifying the risks that threaten the achievement of the control objectives, selecting the criteria stated in the assertion, and designing, implementing, and documenting controls that are suitably designed and operating effectively to achieve the related control objectives stated in the Description.\n",
      "Service Auditor’s Responsibilities\n",
      "Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the Description and on the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of the controls to achieve the related control objectives stated in the Description, based on our examination.\n",
      "Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3402, Assurance Reports on Controls at a Service Organization, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB).\n",
      "Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether, in all material respects, based on the criteria in management’s assertion, the Description is fairly presented, and the controls were suitably designed and operating effectively to achieve the related control objectives stated in the Description throughout the period October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n",
      "An examination of a Description of a service organization’s system and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls involves:\n",
      "• Performing procedures to obtain evidence about the fairness of the presentation of the Description and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of the controls to achieve the related control objectives stated in the Description, based on the criteria in management’s assertion.\n",
      "• Assessing the risks that the Description is not fairly presented and that the controls were not suitably designed or operating effectively to achieve the related control objectives stated in the Description.\n",
      "• Testing the operating effectiveness of those controls that management considers necessary to provide reasonable assurance that the related control objectives stated in the Description were achieved.\n",
      "• Evaluating the overall presentation of the Description, suitability of the control objectives stated therein, and suitability of the criteria specified by the service organization in its assertion.\n",
      "Service Auditor’s Independence and Quality Control\n",
      "We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code of Professional Conduct established by the AICPA and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants.\n",
      "We have complied with those requirements.\n",
      "We applied the Statements on Quality Control Standards established by the AICPA and the International Standards on Quality Management issued by the IAASB and, accordingly, maintain a comprehensive system of quality control.\n",
      "Inherent Limitations\n",
      "The Description is prepared to meet the common needs of a broad range of user entities and their auditors who audit and report on user entities’ financial statements and therefore may not include every aspect of the system that each individual user entity may consider important in its own particular environment.\n",
      "Because of their nature, controls at a service organization may not prevent, or detect and correct, all misstatements in processing or reporting transactions.\n",
      "Also, the projection to the future of any evaluation of the fairness of the presentation of the Description, or conclusions about the suitability of the design or operating effectiveness of the controls to achieve the related control objectives, is subject to the risk that controls at a service organization may become ineffective.\n",
      "Description of Tests of Controls\n",
      "The specific controls tested, and the nature, timing, and results of those tests are listed in Section 4, “Management of Microsoft’s Description of Its Control Objectives and Related Controls, and Independent Service Auditor’s Description of Tests of Controls and Results.”\n",
      "Emphasis of a Matter – Cyber Incident\n",
      "Microsoft has publicly acknowledged cyberattacks by a state-sponsored entity known as Midnight Blizzard.\n",
      "Passwords and other secrets were exfiltrated, allowing access to certain source code repositories, additional secrets, databases, and applications.\n",
      "Microsoft acknowledged that certain passwords, secrets, and code repositories relevant to this report were accessed or exfiltrated.\n",
      "Microsoft represented that these passwords and secrets have been rotated or remediated.\n",
      "Microsoft also stated that code repository access gained by the threat actor was not and cannot be used to make production changes.\n",
      "We inspected certain listings provided by Microsoft of applications, resources, and code repositories impacted by these incidents, including those aligned to passwords and secrets that were accessed.\n",
      "We did not identify evidence that contradicts Microsoft’s explanations and representations.\n",
      "Microsoft has determined that the incident was closed on October 15, 2024.\n",
      "Opinion\n",
      "In our opinion, in all material respects, based on the criteria described in management of Microsoft’s assertion:\n",
      "a. The Description fairly presents the M365 Central Services system that was designed and implemented throughout the period October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024.\n",
      "b. The controls related to the control objectives stated in the Description were suitably designed to provide reasonable assurance that the control objectives would be achieved if the controls operated effectively throughout the period October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, and subservice organization and user entities applied the complementary controls assumed in the design of Microsoft’s controls throughout the period October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024.\n",
      "c. The controls operated effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the control objectives stated in the Description were achieved, throughout the period October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, and if complementary subservice organization and user entity controls assumed in the design of Microsoft’s controls operated effectively throughout the period October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024.\n",
      "Restricted Use\n",
      "This report, including the description of tests of controls and results in Section 4, is intended solely for the information and use of management of Microsoft, user entities of Microsoft’s M365 Central Services system during some or all of the period October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, and their auditors who audit and report on such user entities’ financial statements or internal control over financial reporting and have a sufficient understanding to consider it, along with other information including information about controls implemented by user entities themselves, when assessing the risks of material misstatement of user entities’ financial statements.\n",

      "For the period from 10/1/2023 to 9/30/2024\n",
      "We have prepared the description of the Microsoft 365 Central Services system (“M365”) of Management of Microsoft Corporation (the “Service Organization” or “Microsoft”) for processing user entities’ transactions throughout the period October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, included in Section 3, “Management of Microsoft’s Description of Its Microsoft 365 Central Services System” (the “Description”), for user entities of the system during some or all of the period October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, and their auditors who audit and report on such user entities’ financial statements or internal control over financial reporting and have a sufficient understanding to consider it, along with other information, including information about controls implemented by the subservice organizations and user entities of the system themselves, when assessing the risks of material misstatements of user entities’ financial statements.\n",
      "The Service Organization uses Microsoft Azure (“Azure”) including the Microsoft Datacenters service (“subservice organization”) for its hosting of physical and virtual servers, network management, data protection and storage services.\n",
      "The Description in Section 3 includes only the controls and related control objectives of Microsoft and excludes the control objectives and related controls of the subservice organization.\n",

      "The Description indicates that certain control objectives specified in the Description can be achieved only if complementary user entity controls assumed in the design of Microsoft’s controls are suitably designed and operating effectively, along with related controls at Microsoft.\n",
      "The Description does not extend to controls of the user entities.\n",
      "We confirm, to the best of our knowledge and belief, that:\n",
      "1. The Description fairly presents the M365 Central Services system made available to user entities of the system during some or all of the period October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, for processing their transactions as it relates to controls that are likely to be relevant to user entities’ internal control over financial reporting.\n",
      "The criteria we used in making this assertion were that the Description:\n",
      "a. Presents how the system made available to user entities of the system was designed and implemented to process relevant user entity transactions, including, if applicable:\n",
      "i. The types of services provided including, as appropriate, the classes of transactions processed.\n",
      "ii.\n",
      "The procedures, within both automated and manual systems, by which those services are provided, including, as appropriate, procedures by which transactions are initiated, authorized, recorded, processed, corrected as necessary, and transferred to the reports and other information prepared for user entities of the system.\n",
      "iii.\n",
      "The information used in the performance of the procedures, including, if applicable, related accounting records, whether electronic or manual, and supporting information involved in initiating, authorizing, recording, processing, and reporting transactions; this includes the correction of incorrect information and how information is transferred to the reports and other information prepared for user entities.\n",
      "iv.\n",

      "b. Includes relevant details of changes to the service organization’s system during the period covered by the Description.\n",
      "c. Does not omit or distort information relevant to the service organization’s system, while acknowledging that the Description is prepared to meet the common needs of a broad range of user entities of the system and their user auditors and may not, therefore, include every aspect of the M365 Central Services system that each individual user entity of the system and its user auditor may consider important in its own particular environment.\n",
      "2. The controls related to the control objectives stated in the Description were suitably designed and operated effectively throughout the period October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, to achieve those control objectives if the subservice organization and user entities applied the complementary controls assumed in the design of Microsoft’s controls throughout the period October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024.\n",
      "The criteria we used in making this assertion were that:\n",
      "a. The risks that threaten the achievement of the control objectives stated in the Description have been identified by management of Microsoft.\n",
      "b. The controls identified in the Description would, if operating effectively, provide reasonable assurance that those risks would not prevent the control objectives stated in the Description from being achieved.\n",
      "c. The controls were consistently applied as designed, including whether manual controls were applied by individuals who have the appropriate competence and authority.\n",

      "Control Objective 1: Logical access controls exist to provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized access to key systems is restricted.\n",
      "Overview Background Checks\n",
      "Backgrounds checks are required and renewed every 2 years for all full-time employees and vendors internationally, as permitted by the laws of each country, before access is granted to certain eligibilities within each workstream.\n",
      "Microsoft full-time employees request background checks, when necessary, through the OSP employee portal.\n",
      "A notification is sent to the requesting employee’s manager for approval.\n",
      "If approved, a notification email is sent to Microsoft HR to process a background check for the requesting employee.\n",
      "When the background check is complete, HR enters the results into SAP.\n",
      "For vendors and contractors, vendor companies are responsible for completing a valid background check for each contracted vendor.\n",
      "Once completed, Microsoft receives an attestation letter from the vendor company confirming the completion and pass status of the vendor’s background check.\n",
      "Once the background check validation is received, Microsoft enters relevant information into SAP through the ECS interface.\n",
      "Background check information for FTEs and vendors is pushed from SAP to an IDM database, after which the IDM tool checks for employee background check information before access to M365 cloud environments can be requested by the employee.\n",
      "Full and incremental sync jobs run to keep the data used by the IDM tool current.\n",
      "Service administrators configure requirements, including background check, for eligibilities within each workstream.\n",
      "If no background check is on file, or if a background check has expired, the user receives an error indicating that the employee does not have required background check, thus preventing the employee or vendor from obtaining those eligibilities.\n",
      "Identity Access Management\n",
      "Microsoft 365 owns and manages tools that regulate access to M365 production environments.\n",
      "Most service teams use the IDM access management service to limit access to authorized users.\n",
      "The service, managed by the Access Control team, allows each of the other service teams to manage their respective AD clusters for their respective environment.\n",
      "Several backend processes synchronize with other internal Microsoft tools, such as Microsoft HR department systems, to check that user information (e.g., employment status, manager, cost center, background check information) meets predefined requirements.\n",
      "Users who meet predefined criteria can request access to certain eligibilities, and access is only granted after approval.\n",
      "Some access is regulated outside the IDM service via other tools and processes; however, the functionality and processes are the same.\n",
      "These tools include IDWeb and OneIdentity.\n",
      "New User or Modification of User Access\n",
      "The process to request and approve new access via access management tools is managed through automated workflows configured within the tools.\n",
      "The systems automatically route access requests to the requestor’s manager for approval.\n",
      "Users who meet specified requirements (e.g. active user, active manager, applicable cost center, or background check) can request specific access to rights within each environment.\n",
      "User requests trigger notifications to the user’s manager via email of a pending access request requiring manager approval.\n",
      "No access is provisioned within production environments until manager approval is obtained.\n",
      "There are certain groups, roles, or entitlements that fall outside the automated provisioning processes described above.\n",
      "In each case users must still submit access requests, and each request must be approved before the access is manually provisioned.\n",
      "External Users (Customer Entities) – When a new customer is added to the M365 service, they are provided with an initial account for system setup.\n",
      "The provisioning of users and deactivation of users is the responsibility of the customer entity.\n",
      "Termination Access Removal\n",
      "When individuals leave the company, Microsoft HR updates the terminated employee’s details in the HR system, which syncs to access management tools via backend tasks.\n",
      "Access for terminated employees is then removed from respective service production environments.\n",
      "Without the appropriate entitlements, the user cannot access services within the M365 environment.\n",
      "Periodic User Access Review\n",
      "Services using the automated access provisioning processes above rely on workflows within the systems to automatically revoke user access based on the following criteria:\n",
      "• Inactivity - after 56 days of inactivity, the user’s account is disabled.\n",
      "• Manager Change - when a user’s manager and/or cost center has changed, users must re-request access using the same process described above, and the new manager must approve the user’s requested access.\n",
      "• Group Pre-defined Expiration - where applicable, services have security groups that have a set expiration period from when an account was granted access to the group.\n",
      "Periodic reviews, both manual and automated, are conducted to verify that each user’s access remains relevant and aligns with their job responsibilities.\n",
      "Some of these reviews use the automated M365 UAR Tool, while others are tracked manually by the services.\n",
      "Just-in-Time Access\n",
      "Just-in-time (JIT) tools allow individuals to request temporary elevated access privileges on an as-needed basis to limited areas within the respective service team’s associated production environments.\n",
      "Each tool follows a similar process before granting temporary elevated access to requesting engineers.\n",
      "Automated configurations within each tool notify the submitting user’s manager with details of the access requested.\n",
      "If approved, the requesting user is granted access on a temporary basis, and the tool automatically removes the requested access based on built-in functionality within the tool.\n",
      "In certain cases, an engineer may receive a one-time preapproval for access elevations to specific areas within an environment; however, the access is still temporary in duration.\n",
      "Additionally, each elevation is logged and retained by the service team for incident evaluations.\n",
      "Developer/Operations Model - Developer Access to Production\n",
      "Using the Access tools described above the service teams have restricted access to appropriate personnel, including the enforcement of segregation between developers and operations personnel.\n",
      "Select service teams allow developers temporary access to production using the JIT tools and approval processes described above.\n",
      "Developer access is limited to specific areas of the environment for deployment or operations purposes.\n",
      "These limitations are enforced using Torus, a Remote PowerShell tool.\n",
      "Torus allows for the restriction of access to specific commands that can be run in the service team’s environment and requires approvals for each command being requested.\n",
      "The Torus request and approval process is managed by the JIT tools described above.\n",
      "For requests to make changes to production code or data by a developer or operator, an associated deployment request ticket must be provided and approved by a separate individual.\n",
      "Authentication\n",
      "Internal users are authenticated using Remote Desktop Services and must be authenticated using a two-factor authentication mechanism that includes a smartcard with PIN to log into the RDG.\n",
      "After logging in to the RDG, the user must enter his/her production account user ID and password to access production servers.\n",

      "The service grants Microsoft engineers temporary access to customer content on as- needed basis only as approved by an appropriate tenant authority.\n",
      "The following sections, prefixed with “Customer Lockbox,” detail the procedures in place to limit Microsoft access to customer generated content.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Authorization and Notification\n",
      "Access to customer content for customers utilizing the Customer Lockbox feature is initiated through a Service Request made via Microsoft’s customer support.\n",
      "If the Service Request requires access to customer content, the access is requested through the Customer Lockbox tool.\n",
      "Individuals who are approved to access the customer content do so using the Remote PowerShell (RPS) tool.\n",
      "Only Microsoft engineers with appropriate access entitlements within the Exchange environment, can request temporary elevation to the ‘AccessToCustomerData’ role, which allows access to customer content.\n",
      "The request process is built into Customer Lockbox.\n",
      "If approved by the role owners, Microsoft managers, the request is then routed to a customer contact for additional approval.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Customer Approval\n",
      "The automated workflows supporting the Customer Lockbox elevation process require that elevation requests are first approved by Microsoft management before being submitted to a tenant administrator.\n",
      "Tenant administrators are assigned and are the responsibility of each customer.\n",
      "If the request is not approved within a specified period of time by both the Microsoft management and the tenant administrator, then the elevation request times out and becomes invalid.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Associated Service Request\n",
      "Each elevation request made using Customer Lockbox must reference an associated service request number before submission to Microsoft management for approval.\n",
      "Attempts to submit an elevation request without an associated service request number will fail, and the RPS tool will return an error.\n",
      "Service requests are either submitted by the effected customer or created and communicated to the customer prior to the elevation request.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Microsoft 365 Admin Center\n",
      "M365 customers can review a history of Customer Lockbox elevation requests within the customer’s M365 Admin Center.\n",
      "The history includes relevant information for current and past elevation requests, including the date, service request number, duration of elevation, reason for elevation, and requestor.\n",
      "The logs are kept for a reasonable period of time.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Searchable Audit Logs\n",
      "Server activity is logged for each Customer Lockbox elevation, and the activity log repository is available to each Customer Lockbox customer.\n",
      "Activity logs show what actions and commands were executed on a server containing customer content by a Microsoft engineer for the time allowed during an elevation requested through Customer Lockbox.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Management Review of Elevations\n",
      "Microsoft management pulls logs of Customer Lockbox elevations, as well as capacity server administrator elevations, from a data repository and investigates any anomalies.\n",

      "Service Encryption with Customer Key in Microsoft 365\n",
      "Control Objective 6: Controls provide reasonable assurance customer mailboxes are encrypted using customer keys, data that is deleted per request is no longer accessible, and customers data is isolated to those with access to the appropriate customer key.\n",
      "For customers utilizing the Service Encryption with Customer Key feature, Microsoft 365 provides customers with two application level encryption options for their data within Exchange and SharePoint service: 1) Service Encryption with Microsoft owned encryption keys, and 2) Service Encryption with customer-owned keys (“Customer Keys”).\n",
      "In the standard Microsoft Service Encryption described above, M365 owns the encryption keys for the customer’s Exchange mailboxes and SharePoint sites.\n",
      "Service Encryption with Customer Key (“Customer Key”) is an opt-in encryption offering that allows M365 customers to supply and manage their own encryption keys for advanced, self-managed protection.\n",
      "The Customer Key offering is available in both the Exchange Online Worldwide, GCC-M, GCC-H, Department of Defense environment, as well as the SharePoint Online Worldwide environment.\n",
      "Each “Customer Key” subscription a customer maintains has its own service tenant encryption identifier, and two corresponding Azure-hosted customer key vaults.\n",
      "The customer keys are housed in Azure Key Vault; the onboarding process is inclusive of an Azure subscription creation, which customers will then use to house their keys which correspond with their “Customer Key” service.\n",
      "The two respective Azure Key Vaults each maintain a unique encryption key provided by the customer during the “Customer Key” onboarding process.\n",
      "For EXO: The “Customer Key” model can be applied to all users within a customer’s AD environment or can be segregated based on customer preferred user groupings or business unit differentiations.\n",
      "Each respective Exchange “Customer Key” subscription instance maintains its own Data Encryption Policy (“DEP”) that must be configured by the customer admin during the onboarding process as well.\n",
      "Once a DEP has been created, the customer can provision AD user mailboxes to that DEP, applying that encryption policy to the user mailboxes provisioned to that Customer Key DEP.\n",
      "For SPO: The Customer Key model is applied at the tenant level via Tenant Intermediate Keys \"TIKs\"; if a customer opts-in to Customer Key, all SharePoint site instances are encrypted at the application layer.\n",
      "Customer mailboxes or SharePoint sites associated with a Customer Key DEP or TIK are only accessible through utilizing the customer root keys relevant to each encryption policy type, which are stored in Azure Key Vault.\n",
      "Through Azure, Microsoft maintains its own interim keys, but an interim key does not have the ability to decrypt customer data.\n",
      "Under rare circumstances, Microsoft may need to access resources with customer content to perform specific service oriented and maintenance tasks.\n",
      "To do this the service performs a customer key wrap operation, in which Microsoft’s interim key is sent to Azure blob storage to be wrapped with a data blob of the customer key.\n",
      "The Azure key wrap function does not allow Microsoft access to the unique customer root keys themselves; the interim keys are instead wrapped with the root key data for access purposes.\n",
      "Once retrieved, the Microsoft engineer can access resources with customer data to perform the relevant service tasks.\n",
      "Once the tasks are complete, an unwrap operation is performed, in which the wrapped interim key is sent to Azure blob storage to be unwrapped and consequently disassociated from the customer root key housed in Azure Key Vault.\n",
      "Unwrapped interim keys cannot access Customer Key encrypted data.\n",
      "Microsoft provides additional protections if the customer owned root keys are lost or stolen with an “Availability Key”, which provides M365 customers with the capability to recover from the unanticipated loss of root keys.\n",
      "Microsoft will either assist customers through this process or provide customers with instructions on how to recover without assistance from Microsoft.\n",
      "The Availability Key is a root key that is provisioned and protected by Microsoft and is functionally equivalent to the root keys that are supplied by the customer for use with service encryption with “Customer Key.”\n",
      "Because the Availability Key is protected by Microsoft, it uses a different security design and controls from keys that the customer manages.\n",
      "This provides defense-in-depth and protects against the loss of all keys from a single attack or point of failure.\n",
      "Sharing the responsibility to protect the keys, while using a variety of protections and processes for key management, ultimately reduces the risk that all keys will be lost or destroyed.\n",
      "Service Encryption with Customer Key in Microsoft 365 – Termination\n",
      "Customers can opt out of the Service Encryption with Customer Key service.\n",
      "For EXO, customers can revoke root key access, either through group divestiture at a DEP level or through full-service exit.\n",
      "Since the TIK applies to all SharePoint instances, opting out of the Customer Key service consequently applies to all of the tenant’s SharePoint instances.\n",
      "When a tenant wishes to opt-out of the Service Encryption with Customer Key service, the Exchange and SharePoint tenant administrators must confirm that the customer is truly opting out of the service and wants the data to be deleted.\n",
      "Once a customer opts-out of the service, deletes their own root keys, and signs the eDocument stating their service termination, Microsoft locks the customer out of their data as a confirmation step that the tenant would truly like that data to be deleted.\n",
      "Once this step has been taken, the customer’s executive team must formally communicate the opt-out decision on behalf of the customer via signed and notarized documentation.\n",
      "Microsoft will maintain their root key to the customer’s data until the executive confirmation of service termination has been received, or the 90- to 180-day deletion period threshold has been reached.\n",
      "Once the customer service termination confirmation has been communicated, the customer can request that Microsoft delete its root key access to the data in question.\n",
      "Change Management\n",
      "Control Objective 2: Changes to application programs and related data management systems are authorized, tested, documented, approved, and implemented consistent with management’s intentions.\n",
      "Service Infrastructure and Support Systems Change Management\n",
      "Service- and support-related changes follow an established change management process for the M365 environment.\n",
      "Each change is tracked within identified ticketing systems, which contain information that can be linked to approval and testing details related to the change.\n",
      "These ticketing systems are listed in the Software section above.\n",
      "Appropriate authorizations and approvals needed for the changes being made to these environments are defined in the tickets.\n",
      "When service teams or customer representatives enter a request for a change to the M365 environment in the change management systems, a representative of the relevant workstream is charged with addressing the change request.\n",
      "If a code modification is required, the addressor will perform a pull request, which replicates the master branch’s code and allows the user to perform necessary code modifications without disrupting the live code running in production.\n",
      "Each individual change or addition made to address the change request is subject to a peer review in which another workstream representative reviews and approves the individual code changes.\n",
      "Once a change is peer reviewed and approved, it is checked into a build, along with other changes that are currently in the workstream’s deployment process.\n",
      "Each build is subject to security and static analysis testing to test for the presence of security vulnerabilities.\n",
      "Except for in specific scenarios, M365 environment change management processes require 100% testing pass rates prior to moving forward in the deployment process.\n",
      "When a build successfully completes security testing, it is deployed to preproduction environments for integration testing.\n",
      "Builds can be independently deployed to the preproduction environments or multiple builds can be aggregated into a “release,” which is subject to integration testing.\n",
      "Code that has successfully completed all testing types is then deployed to the master code repository and is recognized as the newest version of the workstream’s source code.\n",
      "There are generally three types of preproduction environments, or “rings,” for ring validation integration testing:\n",
      "• DogFood: The workstream’s initial test ring consisting of a subset of Microsoft employees and customers who test changes on Microsoft’s behalf.\n",
      "• MSIT: The MSIT ring allows the release to be subject to testing by all Microsoft employees.\n",
      "• Slice in Production (SIP): Once the release is successfully integrated into the MSIT ring, it is moved into the SIP environment, which consists of about 5% worldwide customers who have decided to opt in and are able to provide feedback.\n",
      "Certain types of changes in M365 change management systems are subject to additional review and approval processes dependent on the nature of the change.\n",
      "The four approval levels based on the nature and impact of the change have been included below:\n",
      "• Auto-approval – A set of preapproved, low-risk standard changes.\n",
      "• Functional (Peer) Approval – Standard changes with a slightly higher level of risk.\n",
      "• Change Advisory Board Approval – Changes with the potential for high risk and high impact.\n",
      "• Emergency Change Advisory Board Approval – A risk that must be remediated timely, such as an out of band security patch.\n",
      "M365 service teams use a variety of tools to deploy changes to Azure.\n",
      "The ability to deploy code is restricted to appropriate build deployers using a combination of IDM, Torus, and Lockbox permissions.\n",
      "Security Development Lifecycle\n",
      "M365 environments follow the standard Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) process which includes, at a minimum, risk assessment, testing, approval, and documentation.\n",
      "The SDL process includes security development requirements, which are intended to reduce the number of security-related bugs that appear in the design, code, and documentation associated with a software release, as well as to detect and remove those bugs as early in the SDL as possible.\n",
      "Risk assessment and design review occurs in a Change Advisory Board entitled “Office Hours” whose members formally “Approve” or “Deny” any major or significant change prior to implementation.\n",
      "Members include representatives from Compliance, Security, and Microsoft Legal teams.\n",
      "Testing, including code reviews, occurs during the development and build processes.\n",
      "Results of the tests, reviews, and approvals are tracked through ticketing systems used by each team.\n",
      "These ticketing systems are listed in the Software section above.\n",
      "Data Redundancy\n",
      "Control Objective 3: Data redundancy controls exist to provide reasonable assurance that key information is replicated or backed up and can be restored in a timely manner.\n",
      "Data Replication and Data Redundancy\n",
      "Data for customer content, applications and support services is replicated for redundancy and disaster recovery purposes.\n",
      "M365 applications and supporting services are generally replicated from the primary content database to a secondary content database within the same primary datacenter.\n",
      "The primary and secondary databases are then replicated across geographically dispersed datacenters.\n",
      "Generally, the data maintained in the primary content database is replicated and accessible in real time via: (1) the primary database; (2) a secondary replication database located in the same primary datacenter with real time data; (3) a secondary disaster recovery server with real time replicated data in a geographically segregated datacenter; or (4) a server with a few minutes lag replication in a geographically dispersed datacenter.\n",
      "Data is accessible for redundancy and disaster recovery purposes for applications and support services through the data replication process described above, to meet the SLA requirements.\n",
      "It should be noted that the replication process described above reflects the processes in place for the EXO and SPO systems at an overall level.\n",
      "The supporting service teams perform similar replication processes, such as utilizing an Active-Active (e.g., EOP) replication process, but do not maintain lag copies of data.\n",
      "Azure based services rely on Azure capabilities for geo-redundant replication and storage.\n",
      "Business Continuity\n",
      "The majority of M365 service teams participate in the Enterprise Business Continuity Management (EBCM) program that uses a common set of criteria to determine the relevancy and frequency of failover exercises.\n",
      "Teams not yet integrated into the EBCM process perform periodic failover testing.\n",
      "Where relevant, failover exercises are conducted on a regular basis to test applications and related data to verify the accessibility at a secondary disaster recovery location.\n",
      "The frequency of conducting failover exercises, as well as the recovery time objectives (RTOs) for each application and support service, are based on the nature and criticality of the systems.\n",
      "The RTOs are developed as part of the overall M365 Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Planning.\n",
      "The primary objective of conducting failover exercises is to test whether the RTOs may be met in case of a disaster.\n",
      "Issues identified as part of the failover tests are tracked to ultimate resolution.\n",
      "Customer Termination\n",
      "Customer content is retained after termination of M365 subscriptions per agreed upon commitments with the customer in the contract and SLAs.\n",
      "Customers are responsible for the upload/download and management of data stored within the M365 environments related to confidentiality.\n",
      "Monitoring and Incident Management\n",
      "Control Objective 4: The security of the environment is monitored to provide reasonable assurance that security vulnerabilities are detected and remediated.\n",
      "Vulnerability and Patch Management\n",
      "The M365 Security team monitors for known configuration and patching vulnerabilities through automated scans based on Qualys technology.\n",
      "A master server is configured to scan each server across the M365 applications and supporting services suite to analyze and report known vulnerabilities and patch non-compliance.\n",
      "Each service team reviews the vulnerability scan report from the master server and assesses the criticality of the vulnerabilities and applies patches as applicable.\n",
      "New vulnerabilities (e.g., those from responsible disclosure programs) are communicated to M365 through the Microsoft Security Response Center.\n",
      "If a patch is developed for the vulnerability, each service team evaluates the relevance of the patch to its environment and applies the patch as applicable.\n",
      "Security Incident Monitoring\n",
      "M365 has implemented incident response procedures, which consist of technical mechanisms, organizational infrastructure, and other procedures to detect, respond, and deter security incidents.\n",
      "The M365 incident management technical infrastructure includes monitoring systems for detecting and alerting M365 personnel of security events and incidents.\n",
      "A monitoring agent is installed on each server at the time of server build-out to transfer the security logs to the Security Incident Response (SIR) team, which identifies potential incidents and serves as a central repository for investigations.\n",
      "Incidents posing significant risk to the environment are prioritized for response and mitigation.\n",
      "Additionally, each service team has on-call personnel covering a 24/7 schedule.\n",
      "If an incident is assigned a high enough severity, applicable contingency plans are invoked.\n",
      "When a contingency plan is invoked, the incident manager on shift works with the M365 Security team to implement the contingency plan.\n",
      "Server Build-Out Process\n",
      "M365 has a defined server build-out process to deploy and configure new servers and rebuild existing servers.\n",
      "As part of the server build-out process, each service team performs the following:\n",
      "• Connect the server to the specified domain.\n",
      "• Install antimalware agents to get up to date antimalware signature files and definitions.\n",
      "• Install a server agent to collect server activities and upload the logs to the Security Incident Response (SIR) team databases for security assessment activities.\n",
      "After the base server image is applied and the related build-out process is finished, quality assurance reviews are conducted to validate that the server build-out process completed as expected.\n",
      "The quality assurance review follows a process for server build-out compliance:\n",
      "• Automated build-out tool:\n",
      "Application and supporting service teams that leverage an automated build-out and deployment process utilize a scan performed by the deployment tool to substantiate the build had completed successfully.\n",
      "If there is a failure, the tool attempts to redeploy the build until successful.\n",
      "Certain services leverage Microsoft’s Azure PaaS offerings for server build-out and management.\n",
      "Teams who use Azure IaaS with customized server images maintain, update, and test server images as part of the deployment process.\n",
      "Once the server image has been tested, it is provided to Azure for actual deployment.\n",
      "Control Objectives and Related Control Activities\n",
      "The control objectives and related control activities are documented in Section 4 to reduce the redundancy that would result from listing them in this section and repeating them in Section 4.\n",
      "The control objectives and related control activities are however an integral part of the description of the system.\n",
      "While listed in Section 4, the service organization remains responsible for the representations in the description of controls.\n",

      "Microsoft’s IA department provides support to management across the company by independently and objectively analyzing whether the objectives of management are adequately performed, as well as facilitating process improvements and the adoption of business practices, policies, and controls governing worldwide operations.\n",
      "Monitoring of Subservice Organizations\n",
      "M365 uses Microsoft Azure (“Azure”) including the Microsoft Datacenters service, which manages datacenters, IaaS, and PaaS supporting services for the M365 applications including hosting of servers, network support, authentication, virtual server hosting and system data storage.\n",
      "Note that M365 considers Azure and Microsoft Datacenters as two separate organizations within this report and are defined as such.\n",
      "The M365 GRC team is responsible for identifying dependencies of each service and monitoring the organizations’ implementation of agreed-upon security, availability, processing integrity, and confidentiality controls.\n",
      "Dependencies are documented in Inter-Service Agreements.\n",
      "Monitoring includes, but is not limited to, the review of third-party service auditor reports and discussions with subservice organization management.\n",
      "A brief overview of the subservice organizations used by Microsoft 365 is below.\n",
      " | Organization | Brief Description\n",
      " | Microsoft Azure | Microsoft Azure’s cloud Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings are used by M365 to host production data and handle logical access and change management controls for M365.\n",
      " | Microsoft Datacenters | Microsoft Datacenters’ Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offerings are used by M365 to host physical and virtual servers and system data storage.\n",
      "Microsoft Datacenters also handles physical and environmental security controls for M365.\n",
      "\n",
      "System Incidents\n",
      "There were no significant system incidents identified that (a) were the result of controls that were not suitably designed or operating effectively to achieve one or more of the control objectives or (b) otherwise resulted in a significant failure in the achievement of one or more of those control objectives during the period October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024.\n",
      "Significant Changes\n",
      "There were no changes that are likely to affect report users’ understanding of how the system is used to provide the service since the last issued report covering the period ended September 30, 2023.\n",
      "Please see the Software section above for details over the in-scope services.\n",
      "Description of Control Activities\n",
      "Logical Access\n",
      " | Control Objective 1 | Logical access controls exist to provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized access to key systems is restricted.\n",
      " | Change Management Control Objective 2 | Changes to application programs and related data management systems are authorized, tested, documented, approved, and implemented consistent with management’s intentions.\n",
      " | Data Redundancy Control Objective 3 | Data redundancy controls exist to provide reasonable assurance that key information is replicated or backed up and can be restored in a timely manner.\n",

      " | Service Encryption with Customer Key\n",
      " | Control Objective 6 | Controls provide reasonable assurance customer mailboxes are encrypted using customer keys, data that is deleted per request is no longer accessible, and customers data is isolated to those with access to the appropriate customer key.\n",
      "\n",
      "Logical Access\n",
      "Control Objective 1: Logical access controls exist to provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized access to key systems is restricted.\n",
      "Overview Background Checks\n",
      "Backgrounds checks are required and renewed every 2 years for all full-time employees and vendors internationally, as permitted by the laws of each country, before access is granted to certain eligibilities within each workstream.\n",
      "Microsoft full-time employees request background checks, when necessary, through the OSP employee portal.\n",
      "A notification is sent to the requesting employee’s manager for approval.\n",
      "If approved, a notification email is sent to Microsoft HR to process a background check for the requesting employee.\n",
      "When the background check is complete, HR enters the results into SAP.\n",
      "For vendors and contractors, vendor companies are responsible for completing a valid background check for each contracted vendor.\n",
      "Once completed, Microsoft receives an attestation letter from the vendor company confirming the completion and pass status of the vendor’s background check.\n",
      "Once the background check validation is received, Microsoft enters relevant information into SAP through the ECS interface.\n",
      "Background check information for FTEs and vendors is pushed from SAP to an IDM database, after which the IDM tool checks for employee background check information before access to M365 cloud environments can be requested by the employee.\n",
      "Full and incremental sync jobs run to keep the data used by the IDM tool current.\n",
      "Service administrators configure requirements, including background check, for eligibilities within each workstream.\n",
      "If no background check is on file, or if a background check has expired, the user receives an error indicating that the employee does not have required background check, thus preventing the employee or vendor from obtaining those eligibilities.\n",
      "Identity Access Management\n",
      "Microsoft 365 owns and manages tools that regulate access to M365 production environments.\n",
      "Most service teams use the IDM access management service to limit access to authorized users.\n",
      "The service, managed by the Access Control team, allows each of the other service teams to manage their respective AD clusters for their respective environment.\n",
      "Several backend processes synchronize with other internal Microsoft tools, such as Microsoft HR department systems, to check that user information (e.g., employment status, manager, cost center, background check information) meets predefined requirements.\n",
      "Users who meet predefined criteria can request access to certain eligibilities, and access is only granted after approval.\n",
      "Some access is regulated outside the IDM service via other tools and processes; however, the functionality and processes are the same.\n",
      "These tools include IDWeb and OneIdentity.\n",
      "New User or Modification of User Access\n",
      "The process to request and approve new access via access management tools is managed through automated workflows configured within the tools.\n",
      "The systems automatically route access requests to the requestor’s manager for approval.\n",
      "Users who meet specified requirements (e.g. active user, active manager, applicable cost center, or background check) can request specific access to rights within each environment.\n",
      "User requests trigger notifications to the user’s manager via email of a pending access request requiring manager approval.\n",
      "No access is provisioned within production environments until manager approval is obtained.\n",
      "There are certain groups, roles, or entitlements that fall outside the automated provisioning processes described above.\n",
      "In each case users must still submit access requests, and each request must be approved before the access is manually provisioned.\n",
      "External Users (Customer Entities) – When a new customer is added to the M365 service, they are provided with an initial account for system setup.\n",
      "The provisioning of users and deactivation of users is the responsibility of the customer entity.\n",
      "Termination Access Removal\n",
      "When individuals leave the company, Microsoft HR updates the terminated employee’s details in the HR system, which syncs to access management tools via backend tasks.\n",
      "Access for terminated employees is then removed from respective service production environments.\n",
      "Without the appropriate entitlements, the user cannot access services within the M365 environment.\n",
      "Periodic User Access Review\n",
      "Services using the automated access provisioning processes above rely on workflows within the systems to automatically revoke user access based on the following criteria:\n",
      "• Inactivity - after 56 days of inactivity, the user’s account is disabled.\n",
      "• Manager Change - when a user’s manager and/or cost center has changed, users must re-request access using the same process described above, and the new manager must approve the user’s requested access.\n",
      "• Group Pre-defined Expiration - where applicable, services have security groups that have a set expiration period from when an account was granted access to the group.\n",
      "Periodic reviews, both manual and automated, are conducted to verify that each user’s access remains relevant and aligns with their job responsibilities.\n",
      "Some of these reviews use the automated M365 UAR Tool, while others are tracked manually by the services.\n",
      "Just-in-Time Access\n",
      "Just-in-time (JIT) tools allow individuals to request temporary elevated access privileges on an as-needed basis to limited areas within the respective service team’s associated production environments.\n",
      "Each tool follows a similar process before granting temporary elevated access to requesting engineers.\n",
      "Automated configurations within each tool notify the submitting user’s manager with details of the access requested.\n",
      "If approved, the requesting user is granted access on a temporary basis, and the tool automatically removes the requested access based on built-in functionality within the tool.\n",
      "In certain cases, an engineer may receive a one-time preapproval for access elevations to specific areas within an environment; however, the access is still temporary in duration.\n",
      "Additionally, each elevation is logged and retained by the service team for incident evaluations.\n",
      "Developer/Operations Model - Developer Access to Production\n",
      "Using the Access tools described above the service teams have restricted access to appropriate personnel, including the enforcement of segregation between developers and operations personnel.\n",
      "Select service teams allow developers temporary access to production using the JIT tools and approval processes described above.\n",
      "Developer access is limited to specific areas of the environment for deployment or operations purposes.\n",
      "These limitations are enforced using Torus, a Remote PowerShell tool.\n",
      "Torus allows for the restriction of access to specific commands that can be run in the service team’s environment and requires approvals for each command being requested.\n",
      "The Torus request and approval process is managed by the JIT tools described above.\n",
      "For requests to make changes to production code or data by a developer or operator, an associated deployment request ticket must be provided and approved by a separate individual.\n",
      "Authentication\n",
      "Internal users are authenticated using Remote Desktop Services and must be authenticated using a two-factor authentication mechanism that includes a smartcard with PIN to log into the RDG.\n",
      "After logging in to the RDG, the user must enter his/her production account user ID and password to access production servers.\n",
      "The corporate password requirements are defined and configured within code and passwords are automatically generated.\n",
      "These requirements include password complexity, length, history, and duration.\n",
      "Additionally, internal users can gain temporary access to elevated roles allowing access to customer content via the JIT methods described above.\n",
      "For those services that only use JIT elevations to access the environment with no standing access, there are requirements built into the JIT tools for generating onetime complex passwords for authenticating into these environments.\n",
      "External Users – Microsoft provides various options to enable the authentication mechanism for end users and M365 customers.\n",
      "Each external entity is responsible for substantiating that the mechanism is configured and operating, as well as enforcing the use of strong passwords.\n",
      "Data Management Data Segregation\n",
      "Customer content is stored and processed on a shared database which is logically segregated using program logic and a different customer identifier.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox\n",
      "Control Objective 5: Controls provide reasonable assurance that customer content is only accessed when authorized by a designated customer account administrator.\n",
      "For customers utilizing the Customer Lockbox feature, Customer Lockbox is an access control technology included in M365, designed to provide customer control and transparency over access to customer content hosted in Microsoft datacenters.\n",
      "The service grants Microsoft engineers temporary access to customer content on as- needed basis only as approved by an appropriate tenant authority.\n",
      "The following sections, prefixed with “Customer Lockbox,” detail the procedures in place to limit Microsoft access to customer generated content.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Authorization and Notification\n",
      "Access to customer content for customers utilizing the Customer Lockbox feature is initiated through a Service Request made via Microsoft’s customer support.\n",
      "If the Service Request requires access to customer content, the access is requested through the Customer Lockbox tool.\n",
      "Individuals who are approved to access the customer content do so using the Remote PowerShell (RPS) tool.\n",
      "Only Microsoft engineers with appropriate access entitlements within the Exchange environment, can request temporary elevation to the ‘AccessToCustomerData’ role, which allows access to customer content.\n",
      "The request process is built into Customer Lockbox.\n",
      "If approved by the role owners, Microsoft managers, the request is then routed to a customer contact for additional approval.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Customer Approval\n",
      "The automated workflows supporting the Customer Lockbox elevation process require that elevation requests are first approved by Microsoft management before being submitted to a tenant administrator.\n",
      "Tenant administrators are assigned and are the responsibility of each customer.\n",
      "If the request is not approved within a specified period of time by both the Microsoft management and the tenant administrator, then the elevation request times out and becomes invalid.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Associated Service Request\n",
      "Each elevation request made using Customer Lockbox must reference an associated service request number before submission to Microsoft management for approval.\n",
      "Attempts to submit an elevation request without an associated service request number will fail, and the RPS tool will return an error.\n",
      "Service requests are either submitted by the effected customer or created and communicated to the customer prior to the elevation request.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Microsoft 365 Admin Center\n",
      "M365 customers can review a history of Customer Lockbox elevation requests within the customer’s M365 Admin Center.\n",
      "The history includes relevant information for current and past elevation requests, including the date, service request number, duration of elevation, reason for elevation, and requestor.\n",
      "The logs are kept for a reasonable period of time.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Searchable Audit Logs\n",
      "Server activity is logged for each Customer Lockbox elevation, and the activity log repository is available to each Customer Lockbox customer.\n",
      "Activity logs show what actions and commands were executed on a server containing customer content by a Microsoft engineer for the time allowed during an elevation requested through Customer Lockbox.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Management Review of Elevations\n",
      "Microsoft management pulls logs of Customer Lockbox elevations, as well as capacity server administrator elevations, from a data repository and investigates any anomalies.\n",
      "Any anomalies identified are discussed and actioned in a weekly service review.\n",
      "The statistics are aggregated and reviewed annually with Microsoft management.\n",
      "For customers who have chosen to use Customer Lockbox, it is the only way to access customer content.\n",
      "Any other access paths are considered malicious access and are not covered by this attestation.\n",
      "Service Encryption with Customer Key in Microsoft 365\n",
      "Control Objective 6: Controls provide reasonable assurance customer mailboxes are encrypted using customer keys, data that is deleted per request is no longer accessible, and customers data is isolated to those with access to the appropriate customer key.\n",
      "For customers utilizing the Service Encryption with Customer Key feature, Microsoft 365 provides customers with two application level encryption options for their data within Exchange and SharePoint service: 1) Service Encryption with Microsoft owned encryption keys, and 2) Service Encryption with customer-owned keys (“Customer Keys”).\n",
      "In the standard Microsoft Service Encryption described above, M365 owns the encryption keys for the customer’s Exchange mailboxes and SharePoint sites.\n",
      "Service Encryption with Customer Key (“Customer Key”) is an opt-in encryption offering that allows M365 customers to supply and manage their own encryption keys for advanced, self-managed protection.\n",
      "The Customer Key offering is available in both the Exchange Online Worldwide, GCC-M, GCC-H, Department of Defense environment, as well as the SharePoint Online Worldwide environment.\n",
      "Each “Customer Key” subscription a customer maintains has its own service tenant encryption identifier, and two corresponding Azure-hosted customer key vaults.\n",
      "The customer keys are housed in Azure Key Vault; the onboarding process is inclusive of an Azure subscription creation, which customers will then use to house their keys which correspond with their “Customer Key” service.\n",
      "The two respective Azure Key Vaults each maintain a unique encryption key provided by the customer during the “Customer Key” onboarding process.\n",
      "For EXO: The “Customer Key” model can be applied to all users within a customer’s AD environment or can be segregated based on customer preferred user groupings or business unit differentiations.\n",
      "Each respective Exchange “Customer Key” subscription instance maintains its own Data Encryption Policy (“DEP”) that must be configured by the customer admin during the onboarding process as well.\n",
      "Once a DEP has been created, the customer can provision AD user mailboxes to that DEP, applying that encryption policy to the user mailboxes provisioned to that Customer Key DEP.\n",
      "For SPO: The Customer Key model is applied at the tenant level via Tenant Intermediate Keys \"TIKs\"; if a customer opts-in to Customer Key, all SharePoint site instances are encrypted at the application layer.\n",
      "Customer mailboxes or SharePoint sites associated with a Customer Key DEP or TIK are only accessible through utilizing the customer root keys relevant to each encryption policy type, which are stored in Azure Key Vault.\n",
      "Through Azure, Microsoft maintains its own interim keys, but an interim key does not have the ability to decrypt customer data.\n",
      "Under rare circumstances, Microsoft may need to access resources with customer content to perform specific service oriented and maintenance tasks.\n",
      "To do this the service performs a customer key wrap operation, in which Microsoft’s interim key is sent to Azure blob storage to be wrapped with a data blob of the customer key.\n",
      "The Azure key wrap function does not allow Microsoft access to the unique customer root keys themselves; the interim keys are instead wrapped with the root key data for access purposes.\n",
      "Once retrieved, the Microsoft engineer can access resources with customer data to perform the relevant service tasks.\n",
      "Once the tasks are complete, an unwrap operation is performed, in which the wrapped interim key is sent to Azure blob storage to be unwrapped and consequently disassociated from the customer root key housed in Azure Key Vault.\n",
      "Unwrapped interim keys cannot access Customer Key encrypted data.\n",
      "Microsoft provides additional protections if the customer owned root keys are lost or stolen with an “Availability Key”, which provides M365 customers with the capability to recover from the unanticipated loss of root keys.\n",
      "Microsoft will either assist customers through this process or provide customers with instructions on how to recover without assistance from Microsoft.\n",
      "The Availability Key is a root key that is provisioned and protected by Microsoft and is functionally equivalent to the root keys that are supplied by the customer for use with service encryption with “Customer Key.”\n",
      "Because the Availability Key is protected by Microsoft, it uses a different security design and controls from keys that the customer manages.\n",
      "This provides defense-in-depth and protects against the loss of all keys from a single attack or point of failure.\n",
      "Sharing the responsibility to protect the keys, while using a variety of protections and processes for key management, ultimately reduces the risk that all keys will be lost or destroyed.\n",
      "Service Encryption with Customer Key in Microsoft 365 – Termination\n",
      "Customers can opt out of the Service Encryption with Customer Key service.\n",
      "For EXO, customers can revoke root key access, either through group divestiture at a DEP level or through full-service exit.\n",
      "Since the TIK applies to all SharePoint instances, opting out of the Customer Key service consequently applies to all of the tenant’s SharePoint instances.\n",
      "When a tenant wishes to opt-out of the Service Encryption with Customer Key service, the Exchange and SharePoint tenant administrators must confirm that the customer is truly opting out of the service and wants the data to be deleted.\n",
      "Once a customer opts-out of the service, deletes their own root keys, and signs the eDocument stating their service termination, Microsoft locks the customer out of their data as a confirmation step that the tenant would truly like that data to be deleted.\n",
      "Once this step has been taken, the customer’s executive team must formally communicate the opt-out decision on behalf of the customer via signed and notarized documentation.\n",
      "Microsoft will maintain their root key to the customer’s data until the executive confirmation of service termination has been received, or the 90- to 180-day deletion period threshold has been reached.\n",
      "Once the customer service termination confirmation has been communicated, the customer can request that Microsoft delete its root key access to the data in question.\n",
      "Change Management\n",
      "Control Objective 2: Changes to application programs and related data management systems are authorized, tested, documented, approved, and implemented consistent with management’s intentions.\n",
      "Service Infrastructure and Support Systems Change Management\n",
      "Service- and support-related changes follow an established change management process for the M365 environment.\n",
      "Each change is tracked within identified ticketing systems, which contain information that can be linked to approval and testing details related to the change.\n",
      "These ticketing systems are listed in the Software section above.\n",
      "Appropriate authorizations and approvals needed for the changes being made to these environments are defined in the tickets.\n",
      "When service teams or customer representatives enter a request for a change to the M365 environment in the change management systems, a representative of the relevant workstream is charged with addressing the change request.\n",
      "If a code modification is required, the addressor will perform a pull request, which replicates the master branch’s code and allows the user to perform necessary code modifications without disrupting the live code running in production.\n",
      "Each individual change or addition made to address the change request is subject to a peer review in which another workstream representative reviews and approves the individual code changes.\n",
      "Once a change is peer reviewed and approved, it is checked into a build, along with other changes that are currently in the workstream’s deployment process.\n",
      "Each build is subject to security and static analysis testing to test for the presence of security vulnerabilities.\n",
      "Except for in specific scenarios, M365 environment change management processes require 100% testing pass rates prior to moving forward in the deployment process.\n",
      "When a build successfully completes security testing, it is deployed to preproduction environments for integration testing.\n",
      "Builds can be independently deployed to the preproduction environments or multiple builds can be aggregated into a “release,” which is subject to integration testing.\n",
      "Code that has successfully completed all testing types is then deployed to the master code repository and is recognized as the newest version of the workstream’s source code.\n",
      "There are generally three types of preproduction environments, or “rings,” for ring validation integration testing:\n",
      "• DogFood: The workstream’s initial test ring consisting of a subset of Microsoft employees and customers who test changes on Microsoft’s behalf.\n",
      "• MSIT: The MSIT ring allows the release to be subject to testing by all Microsoft employees.\n",
      "• Slice in Production (SIP): Once the release is successfully integrated into the MSIT ring, it is moved into the SIP environment, which consists of about 5% worldwide customers who have decided to opt in and are able to provide feedback.\n",
      "Certain types of changes in M365 change management systems are subject to additional review and approval processes dependent on the nature of the change.\n",
      "The four approval levels based on the nature and impact of the change have been included below:\n",
      "• Auto-approval – A set of preapproved, low-risk standard changes.\n",
      "• Functional (Peer) Approval – Standard changes with a slightly higher level of risk.\n",
      "• Change Advisory Board Approval – Changes with the potential for high risk and high impact.\n",
      "• Emergency Change Advisory Board Approval – A risk that must be remediated timely, such as an out of band security patch.\n",
      "M365 service teams use a variety of tools to deploy changes to Azure.\n",
      "The ability to deploy code is restricted to appropriate build deployers using a combination of IDM, Torus, and Lockbox permissions.\n",
      "Security Development Lifecycle\n",
      "M365 environments follow the standard Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) process which includes, at a minimum, risk assessment, testing, approval, and documentation.\n",
      "The SDL process includes security development requirements, which are intended to reduce the number of security-related bugs that appear in the design, code, and documentation associated with a software release, as well as to detect and remove those bugs as early in the SDL as possible.\n",
      "Risk assessment and design review occurs in a Change Advisory Board entitled “Office Hours” whose members formally “Approve” or “Deny” any major or significant change prior to implementation.\n",
      "Members include representatives from Compliance, Security, and Microsoft Legal teams.\n",
      "Testing, including code reviews, occurs during the development and build processes.\n",
      "Results of the tests, reviews, and approvals are tracked through ticketing systems used by each team.\n",
      "These ticketing systems are listed in the Software section above.\n",
      "Data Redundancy\n",
      "Control Objective 3: Data redundancy controls exist to provide reasonable assurance that key information is replicated or backed up and can be restored in a timely manner.\n",
      "Data Replication and Data Redundancy\n",
      "Data for customer content, applications and support services is replicated for redundancy and disaster recovery purposes.\n",
      "M365 applications and supporting services are generally replicated from the primary content database to a secondary content database within the same primary datacenter.\n",
      "The primary and secondary databases are then replicated across geographically dispersed datacenters.\n",
      "Generally, the data maintained in the primary content database is replicated and accessible in real time via: (1) the primary database; (2) a secondary replication database located in the same primary datacenter with real time data; (3) a secondary disaster recovery server with real time replicated data in a geographically segregated datacenter; or (4) a server with a few minutes lag replication in a geographically dispersed datacenter.\n",
      "Data is accessible for redundancy and disaster recovery purposes for applications and support services through the data replication process described above, to meet the SLA requirements.\n",
      "It should be noted that the replication process described above reflects the processes in place for the EXO and SPO systems at an overall level.\n",
      "The supporting service teams perform similar replication processes, such as utilizing an Active-Active (e.g., EOP) replication process, but do not maintain lag copies of data.\n",
      "Azure based services rely on Azure capabilities for geo-redundant replication and storage.\n",
      "Business Continuity\n",
      "The majority of M365 service teams participate in the Enterprise Business Continuity Management (EBCM) program that uses a common set of criteria to determine the relevancy and frequency of failover exercises.\n",
      "Teams not yet integrated into the EBCM process perform periodic failover testing.\n",
      "Where relevant, failover exercises are conducted on a regular basis to test applications and related data to verify the accessibility at a secondary disaster recovery location.\n",
      "The frequency of conducting failover exercises, as well as the recovery time objectives (RTOs) for each application and support service, are based on the nature and criticality of the systems.\n",
      "The RTOs are developed as part of the overall M365 Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Planning.\n",
      "The primary objective of conducting failover exercises is to test whether the RTOs may be met in case of a disaster.\n",
      "Issues identified as part of the failover tests are tracked to ultimate resolution.\n",
      "Customer Termination\n",
      "Customer content is retained after termination of M365 subscriptions per agreed upon commitments with the customer in the contract and SLAs.\n",
      "Customers are responsible for the upload/download and management of data stored within the M365 environments related to confidentiality.\n",
      "Monitoring and Incident Management\n",
      "Control Objective 4: The security of the environment is monitored to provide reasonable assurance that security vulnerabilities are detected and remediated.\n",
      "Vulnerability and Patch Management\n",
      "The M365 Security team monitors for known configuration and patching vulnerabilities through automated scans based on Qualys technology.\n",
      "A master server is configured to scan each server across the M365 applications and supporting services suite to analyze and report known vulnerabilities and patch non-compliance.\n",
      "Each service team reviews the vulnerability scan report from the master server and assesses the criticality of the vulnerabilities and applies patches as applicable.\n",
      "New vulnerabilities (e.g., those from responsible disclosure programs) are communicated to M365 through the Microsoft Security Response Center.\n",
      "If a patch is developed for the vulnerability, each service team evaluates the relevance of the patch to its environment and applies the patch as applicable.\n",
      "Security Incident Monitoring\n",
      "M365 has implemented incident response procedures, which consist of technical mechanisms, organizational infrastructure, and other procedures to detect, respond, and deter security incidents.\n",
      "The M365 incident management technical infrastructure includes monitoring systems for detecting and alerting M365 personnel of security events and incidents.\n",
      "A monitoring agent is installed on each server at the time of server build-out to transfer the security logs to the Security Incident Response (SIR) team, which identifies potential incidents and serves as a central repository for investigations.\n",

      "Scope\n",
      "We have examined the description of the Microsoft 365 Central Services system (“M365”) of Management of Microsoft Corporation (the “Service Organization” or “Microsoft”) for processing user entities’ transactions throughout the period October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, included in Section 3, “Management of Microsoft’s Description of Its Microsoft 365 Central Services System” (the “Description”) and the suitability of the design and the operating effectiveness of controls included in the Description to achieve the related control objectives stated in the Description, based on the criteria identified in management of Microsoft’s assertion.\n",
      "The controls and control objectives included in the Description are those that management of Microsoft believes are likely to be relevant to user entities’ internal control over financial reporting, and the Description does not include those aspects of the M365 Central Services system that are not likely to be relevant to user entities’ internal control over financial reporting.\n",
      "The information in Section 5, “Supplemental Information Provided by Management of Microsoft” is presented by management of Microsoft to provide additional information and is not a part of management of Microsoft’s Description of its M365 Central Services system made available to user entities during the period October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024.\n",
      "Information in Section 5 has not been subjected to the procedures applied in the examination of the Description of the M365 Central Services system and of the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls to achieve the related control objectives stated in the Description of the M365 Central Services system and, accordingly, we express no opinion on it.\n",
      "The Service Organization uses Microsoft Azure (“Azure”) including the Microsoft Datacenters service (“subservice organization”) for its hosting of physical and virtual servers, network management, data protection and storage services.\n",
      "The Description in Section 3 includes only the controls and related control objectives of Microsoft and excludes the control objectives and related controls of the subservice organization.\n",
      "The Description also indicates that certain control objectives specified by Microsoft can be achieved only if complementary subservice organization controls assumed in the design of Microsoft’s controls are suitably designed and operating effectively, along with the related controls at Microsoft.\n",
      "Our examination did not extend to controls of the subservice organization or their functions, and we have not evaluated the suitability of the design or operating effectiveness of such complementary subservice organization controls.\n",
      "The Description indicates that certain control objectives specified in the Description can be achieved only if complementary user entity controls contemplated in the design of Microsoft’s controls are suitably designed and operating effectively, along with related controls at Microsoft.\n",
      "Our examination did not extend to such complementary user entity controls, and we have not evaluated the suitability of the design or operating effectiveness of such complementary user entity controls.\n",
      "Service Organization’s Responsibilities\n",
      "In Section 2, “Management of Microsoft’s Assertion,” management of Microsoft has provided an assertion about the fairness of the presentation of the Description and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of the controls to achieve the related control objectives stated in the Description.\n",
      "Management of Microsoft is responsible for preparing the Description and its assertion, including the completeness, accuracy, and method of presentation of the Description and the assertion, providing the services covered by the Description, specifying the control objectives and stating them in the Description, identifying the risks that threaten the achievement of the control objectives, selecting the criteria stated in the assertion, and designing, implementing, and documenting controls that are suitably designed and operating effectively to achieve the related control objectives stated in the Description.\n",
      "Service Auditor’s Responsibilities\n",
      "Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the Description and on the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of the controls to achieve the related control objectives stated in the Description, based on our examination.\n",
      "Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3402, Assurance Reports on Controls at a Service Organization, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB).\n",
      "Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether, in all material respects, based on the criteria in management’s assertion, the Description is fairly presented, and the controls were suitably designed and operating effectively to achieve the related control objectives stated in the Description throughout the period October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n",
      "An examination of a Description of a service organization’s system and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls involves:\n",
      "• Performing procedures to obtain evidence about the fairness of the presentation of the Description and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of the controls to achieve the related control objectives stated in the Description, based on the criteria in management’s assertion.\n",
      "• Assessing the risks that the Description is not fairly presented and that the controls were not suitably designed or operating effectively to achieve the related control objectives stated in the Description.\n",
      "• Testing the operating effectiveness of those controls that management considers necessary to provide reasonable assurance that the related control objectives stated in the Description were achieved.\n",
      "• Evaluating the overall presentation of the Description, suitability of the control objectives stated therein, and suitability of the criteria specified by the service organization in its assertion.\n",
      "Service Auditor’s Independence and Quality Control\n",
      "We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code of Professional Conduct established by the AICPA and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants.\n",
      "We have complied with those requirements.\n",
      "We applied the Statements on Quality Control Standards established by the AICPA and the International Standards on Quality Management issued by the IAASB and, accordingly, maintain a comprehensive system of quality control.\n",
      "Inherent Limitations\n",
      "The Description is prepared to meet the common needs of a broad range of user entities and their auditors who audit and report on user entities’ financial statements and therefore may not include every aspect of the system that each individual user entity may consider important in its own particular environment.\n",
      "Because of their nature, controls at a service organization may not prevent, or detect and correct, all misstatements in processing or reporting transactions.\n",
      "Also, the projection to the future of any evaluation of the fairness of the presentation of the Description, or conclusions about the suitability of the design or operating effectiveness of the controls to achieve the related control objectives, is subject to the risk that controls at a service organization may become ineffective.\n",
      "Description of Tests of Controls\n",
      "The specific controls tested, and the nature, timing, and results of those tests are listed in Section 4, “Management of Microsoft’s Description of Its Control Objectives and Related Controls, and Independent Service Auditor’s Description of Tests of Controls and Results.”\n",
      "Emphasis of a Matter – Cyber Incident\n",
      "Microsoft has publicly acknowledged cyberattacks by a state-sponsored entity known as Midnight Blizzard.\n",
      "Passwords and other secrets were exfiltrated, allowing access to certain source code repositories, additional secrets, databases, and applications.\n",
      "Microsoft acknowledged that certain passwords, secrets, and code repositories relevant to this report were accessed or exfiltrated.\n",
      "Microsoft represented that these passwords and secrets have been rotated or remediated.\n",
      "Microsoft also stated that code repository access gained by the threat actor was not and cannot be used to make production changes.\n",
      "We inspected certain listings provided by Microsoft of applications, resources, and code repositories impacted by these incidents, including those aligned to passwords and secrets that were accessed.\n",
      "We did not identify evidence that contradicts Microsoft’s explanations and representations.\n",
      "Microsoft has determined that the incident was closed on October 15, 2024.\n",
      "Opinion\n",
      "In our opinion, in all material respects, based on the criteria described in management of Microsoft’s assertion:\n",
      "a. The Description fairly presents the M365 Central Services system that was designed and implemented throughout the period October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024.\n",
      "b. The controls related to the control objectives stated in the Description were suitably designed to provide reasonable assurance that the control objectives would be achieved if the controls operated effectively throughout the period October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, and subservice organization and user entities applied the complementary controls assumed in the design of Microsoft’s controls throughout the period October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024.\n",
      "c. The controls operated effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the control objectives stated in the Description were achieved, throughout the period October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, and if complementary subservice organization and user entity controls assumed in the design of Microsoft’s controls operated effectively throughout the period October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024.\n",
      "Restricted Use\n",

      "Overview Background Checks\n",
      "Backgrounds checks are required and renewed every 2 years for all full-time employees and vendors internationally, as permitted by the laws of each country, before access is granted to certain eligibilities within each workstream.\n",
      "Microsoft full-time employees request background checks, when necessary, through the OSP employee portal.\n",
      "A notification is sent to the requesting employee’s manager for approval.\n",
      "If approved, a notification email is sent to Microsoft HR to process a background check for the requesting employee.\n",
      "When the background check is complete, HR enters the results into SAP.\n",
      "For vendors and contractors, vendor companies are responsible for completing a valid background check for each contracted vendor.\n",
      "Once completed, Microsoft receives an attestation letter from the vendor company confirming the completion and pass status of the vendor’s background check.\n",
      "Once the background check validation is received, Microsoft enters relevant information into SAP through the ECS interface.\n",
      "Background check information for FTEs and vendors is pushed from SAP to an IDM database, after which the IDM tool checks for employee background check information before access to M365 cloud environments can be requested by the employee.\n",
      "Full and incremental sync jobs run to keep the data used by the IDM tool current.\n",
      "Service administrators configure requirements, including background check, for eligibilities within each workstream.\n",
      "If no background check is on file, or if a background check has expired, the user receives an error indicating that the employee does not have required background check, thus preventing the employee or vendor from obtaining those eligibilities.\n",
      "Identity Access Management\n",
      "Microsoft 365 owns and manages tools that regulate access to M365 production environments.\n",
      "Most service teams use the IDM access management service to limit access to authorized users.\n",
      "The service, managed by the Access Control team, allows each of the other service teams to manage their respective AD clusters for their respective environment.\n",
      "Several backend processes synchronize with other internal Microsoft tools, such as Microsoft HR department systems, to check that user information (e.g., employment status, manager, cost center, background check information) meets predefined requirements.\n",
      "Users who meet predefined criteria can request access to certain eligibilities, and access is only granted after approval.\n",
      "Some access is regulated outside the IDM service via other tools and processes; however, the functionality and processes are the same.\n",
      "These tools include IDWeb and OneIdentity.\n",
      "New User or Modification of User Access\n",
      "The process to request and approve new access via access management tools is managed through automated workflows configured within the tools.\n",
      "The systems automatically route access requests to the requestor’s manager for approval.\n",
      "Users who meet specified requirements (e.g. active user, active manager, applicable cost center, or background check) can request specific access to rights within each environment.\n",
      "User requests trigger notifications to the user’s manager via email of a pending access request requiring manager approval.\n",
      "No access is provisioned within production environments until manager approval is obtained.\n",
      "There are certain groups, roles, or entitlements that fall outside the automated provisioning processes described above.\n",
      "In each case users must still submit access requests, and each request must be approved before the access is manually provisioned.\n",
      "External Users (Customer Entities) – When a new customer is added to the M365 service, they are provided with an initial account for system setup.\n",
      "The provisioning of users and deactivation of users is the responsibility of the customer entity.\n",
      "Termination Access Removal\n",
      "When individuals leave the company, Microsoft HR updates the terminated employee’s details in the HR system, which syncs to access management tools via backend tasks.\n",
      "Access for terminated employees is then removed from respective service production environments.\n",
      "Without the appropriate entitlements, the user cannot access services within the M365 environment.\n",
      "Periodic User Access Review\n",
      "Services using the automated access provisioning processes above rely on workflows within the systems to automatically revoke user access based on the following criteria:\n",
      "• Inactivity - after 56 days of inactivity, the user’s account is disabled.\n",
      "• Manager Change - when a user’s manager and/or cost center has changed, users must re-request access using the same process described above, and the new manager must approve the user’s requested access.\n",
      "• Group Pre-defined Expiration - where applicable, services have security groups that have a set expiration period from when an account was granted access to the group.\n",
      "Periodic reviews, both manual and automated, are conducted to verify that each user’s access remains relevant and aligns with their job responsibilities.\n",
      "Some of these reviews use the automated M365 UAR Tool, while others are tracked manually by the services.\n",
      "Just-in-Time Access\n",
      "Just-in-time (JIT) tools allow individuals to request temporary elevated access privileges on an as-needed basis to limited areas within the respective service team’s associated production environments.\n",
      "Each tool follows a similar process before granting temporary elevated access to requesting engineers.\n",
      "Automated configurations within each tool notify the submitting user’s manager with details of the access requested.\n",
      "If approved, the requesting user is granted access on a temporary basis, and the tool automatically removes the requested access based on built-in functionality within the tool.\n",
      "In certain cases, an engineer may receive a one-time preapproval for access elevations to specific areas within an environment; however, the access is still temporary in duration.\n",
      "Additionally, each elevation is logged and retained by the service team for incident evaluations.\n",
      "Developer/Operations Model - Developer Access to Production\n",
      "Using the Access tools described above the service teams have restricted access to appropriate personnel, including the enforcement of segregation between developers and operations personnel.\n",
      "Select service teams allow developers temporary access to production using the JIT tools and approval processes described above.\n",
      "Developer access is limited to specific areas of the environment for deployment or operations purposes.\n",
      "These limitations are enforced using Torus, a Remote PowerShell tool.\n",
      "Torus allows for the restriction of access to specific commands that can be run in the service team’s environment and requires approvals for each command being requested.\n",
      "The Torus request and approval process is managed by the JIT tools described above.\n",
      "For requests to make changes to production code or data by a developer or operator, an associated deployment request ticket must be provided and approved by a separate individual.\n",
      "Authentication\n",
      "Internal users are authenticated using Remote Desktop Services and must be authenticated using a two-factor authentication mechanism that includes a smartcard with PIN to log into the RDG.\n",
      "After logging in to the RDG, the user must enter his/her production account user ID and password to access production servers.\n",
      "The corporate password requirements are defined and configured within code and passwords are automatically generated.\n",
      "These requirements include password complexity, length, history, and duration.\n",
      "Additionally, internal users can gain temporary access to elevated roles allowing access to customer content via the JIT methods described above.\n",
      "For those services that only use JIT elevations to access the environment with no standing access, there are requirements built into the JIT tools for generating onetime complex passwords for authenticating into these environments.\n",
      "External Users – Microsoft provides various options to enable the authentication mechanism for end users and M365 customers.\n",
      "Each external entity is responsible for substantiating that the mechanism is configured and operating, as well as enforcing the use of strong passwords.\n",
      "Data Management Data Segregation\n",
      "Customer content is stored and processed on a shared database which is logically segregated using program logic and a different customer identifier.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox\n",
      "Control Objective 5: Controls provide reasonable assurance that customer content is only accessed when authorized by a designated customer account administrator.\n",
      "For customers utilizing the Customer Lockbox feature, Customer Lockbox is an access control technology included in M365, designed to provide customer control and transparency over access to customer content hosted in Microsoft datacenters.\n",
      "The service grants Microsoft engineers temporary access to customer content on as- needed basis only as approved by an appropriate tenant authority.\n",
      "The following sections, prefixed with “Customer Lockbox,” detail the procedures in place to limit Microsoft access to customer generated content.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Authorization and Notification\n",
      "Access to customer content for customers utilizing the Customer Lockbox feature is initiated through a Service Request made via Microsoft’s customer support.\n",
      "If the Service Request requires access to customer content, the access is requested through the Customer Lockbox tool.\n",
      "Individuals who are approved to access the customer content do so using the Remote PowerShell (RPS) tool.\n",
      "Only Microsoft engineers with appropriate access entitlements within the Exchange environment, can request temporary elevation to the ‘AccessToCustomerData’ role, which allows access to customer content.\n",
      "The request process is built into Customer Lockbox.\n",
      "If approved by the role owners, Microsoft managers, the request is then routed to a customer contact for additional approval.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Customer Approval\n",
      "The automated workflows supporting the Customer Lockbox elevation process require that elevation requests are first approved by Microsoft management before being submitted to a tenant administrator.\n",
      "Tenant administrators are assigned and are the responsibility of each customer.\n",
      "If the request is not approved within a specified period of time by both the Microsoft management and the tenant administrator, then the elevation request times out and becomes invalid.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Associated Service Request\n",
      "Each elevation request made using Customer Lockbox must reference an associated service request number before submission to Microsoft management for approval.\n",
      "Attempts to submit an elevation request without an associated service request number will fail, and the RPS tool will return an error.\n",
      "Service requests are either submitted by the effected customer or created and communicated to the customer prior to the elevation request.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Microsoft 365 Admin Center\n",
      "M365 customers can review a history of Customer Lockbox elevation requests within the customer’s M365 Admin Center.\n",
      "The history includes relevant information for current and past elevation requests, including the date, service request number, duration of elevation, reason for elevation, and requestor.\n",
      "The logs are kept for a reasonable period of time.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Searchable Audit Logs\n",
      "Server activity is logged for each Customer Lockbox elevation, and the activity log repository is available to each Customer Lockbox customer.\n",
      "Activity logs show what actions and commands were executed on a server containing customer content by a Microsoft engineer for the time allowed during an elevation requested through Customer Lockbox.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Management Review of Elevations\n",
      "Microsoft management pulls logs of Customer Lockbox elevations, as well as capacity server administrator elevations, from a data repository and investigates any anomalies.\n",

      "The statistics are aggregated and reviewed annually with Microsoft management.\n",
      "For customers who have chosen to use Customer Lockbox, it is the only way to access customer content.\n",
      "Any other access paths are considered malicious access and are not covered by this attestation.\n",
      "Service Encryption with Customer Key in Microsoft 365\n",
      "Control Objective 6: Controls provide reasonable assurance customer mailboxes are encrypted using customer keys, data that is deleted per request is no longer accessible, and customers data is isolated to those with access to the appropriate customer key.\n",
      "For customers utilizing the Service Encryption with Customer Key feature, Microsoft 365 provides customers with two application level encryption options for their data within Exchange and SharePoint service: 1) Service Encryption with Microsoft owned encryption keys, and 2) Service Encryption with customer-owned keys (“Customer Keys”).\n",
      "In the standard Microsoft Service Encryption described above, M365 owns the encryption keys for the customer’s Exchange mailboxes and SharePoint sites.\n",
      "Service Encryption with Customer Key (“Customer Key”) is an opt-in encryption offering that allows M365 customers to supply and manage their own encryption keys for advanced, self-managed protection.\n",
      "The Customer Key offering is available in both the Exchange Online Worldwide, GCC-M, GCC-H, Department of Defense environment, as well as the SharePoint Online Worldwide environment.\n",
      "Each “Customer Key” subscription a customer maintains has its own service tenant encryption identifier, and two corresponding Azure-hosted customer key vaults.\n",
      "The customer keys are housed in Azure Key Vault; the onboarding process is inclusive of an Azure subscription creation, which customers will then use to house their keys which correspond with their “Customer Key” service.\n",
      "The two respective Azure Key Vaults each maintain a unique encryption key provided by the customer during the “Customer Key” onboarding process.\n",
      "For EXO: The “Customer Key” model can be applied to all users within a customer’s AD environment or can be segregated based on customer preferred user groupings or business unit differentiations.\n",
      "Each respective Exchange “Customer Key” subscription instance maintains its own Data Encryption Policy (“DEP”) that must be configured by the customer admin during the onboarding process as well.\n",
      "Once a DEP has been created, the customer can provision AD user mailboxes to that DEP, applying that encryption policy to the user mailboxes provisioned to that Customer Key DEP.\n",
      "For SPO: The Customer Key model is applied at the tenant level via Tenant Intermediate Keys \"TIKs\"; if a customer opts-in to Customer Key, all SharePoint site instances are encrypted at the application layer.\n",
      "Customer mailboxes or SharePoint sites associated with a Customer Key DEP or TIK are only accessible through utilizing the customer root keys relevant to each encryption policy type, which are stored in Azure Key Vault.\n",
      "Through Azure, Microsoft maintains its own interim keys, but an interim key does not have the ability to decrypt customer data.\n",
      "Under rare circumstances, Microsoft may need to access resources with customer content to perform specific service oriented and maintenance tasks.\n",
      "To do this the service performs a customer key wrap operation, in which Microsoft’s interim key is sent to Azure blob storage to be wrapped with a data blob of the customer key.\n",
      "The Azure key wrap function does not allow Microsoft access to the unique customer root keys themselves; the interim keys are instead wrapped with the root key data for access purposes.\n",
      "Once retrieved, the Microsoft engineer can access resources with customer data to perform the relevant service tasks.\n",
      "Once the tasks are complete, an unwrap operation is performed, in which the wrapped interim key is sent to Azure blob storage to be unwrapped and consequently disassociated from the customer root key housed in Azure Key Vault.\n",
      "Unwrapped interim keys cannot access Customer Key encrypted data.\n",
      "Microsoft provides additional protections if the customer owned root keys are lost or stolen with an “Availability Key”, which provides M365 customers with the capability to recover from the unanticipated loss of root keys.\n",
      "Microsoft will either assist customers through this process or provide customers with instructions on how to recover without assistance from Microsoft.\n",
      "The Availability Key is a root key that is provisioned and protected by Microsoft and is functionally equivalent to the root keys that are supplied by the customer for use with service encryption with “Customer Key.”\n",
      "Because the Availability Key is protected by Microsoft, it uses a different security design and controls from keys that the customer manages.\n",
      "This provides defense-in-depth and protects against the loss of all keys from a single attack or point of failure.\n",
      "Sharing the responsibility to protect the keys, while using a variety of protections and processes for key management, ultimately reduces the risk that all keys will be lost or destroyed.\n",
      "Service Encryption with Customer Key in Microsoft 365 – Termination\n",
      "Customers can opt out of the Service Encryption with Customer Key service.\n",
      "For EXO, customers can revoke root key access, either through group divestiture at a DEP level or through full-service exit.\n",
      "Since the TIK applies to all SharePoint instances, opting out of the Customer Key service consequently applies to all of the tenant’s SharePoint instances.\n",
      "When a tenant wishes to opt-out of the Service Encryption with Customer Key service, the Exchange and SharePoint tenant administrators must confirm that the customer is truly opting out of the service and wants the data to be deleted.\n",
      "Once a customer opts-out of the service, deletes their own root keys, and signs the eDocument stating their service termination, Microsoft locks the customer out of their data as a confirmation step that the tenant would truly like that data to be deleted.\n",
      "Once this step has been taken, the customer’s executive team must formally communicate the opt-out decision on behalf of the customer via signed and notarized documentation.\n",
      "Microsoft will maintain their root key to the customer’s data until the executive confirmation of service termination has been received, or the 90- to 180-day deletion period threshold has been reached.\n",
      "Once the customer service termination confirmation has been communicated, the customer can request that Microsoft delete its root key access to the data in question.\n",
      "Change Management\n",
      "Control Objective 2: Changes to application programs and related data management systems are authorized, tested, documented, approved, and implemented consistent with management’s intentions.\n",
      "Service Infrastructure and Support Systems Change Management\n",
      "Service- and support-related changes follow an established change management process for the M365 environment.\n",
      "Each change is tracked within identified ticketing systems, which contain information that can be linked to approval and testing details related to the change.\n",
      "These ticketing systems are listed in the Software section above.\n",
      "Appropriate authorizations and approvals needed for the changes being made to these environments are defined in the tickets.\n",
      "When service teams or customer representatives enter a request for a change to the M365 environment in the change management systems, a representative of the relevant workstream is charged with addressing the change request.\n",
      "If a code modification is required, the addressor will perform a pull request, which replicates the master branch’s code and allows the user to perform necessary code modifications without disrupting the live code running in production.\n",
      "Each individual change or addition made to address the change request is subject to a peer review in which another workstream representative reviews and approves the individual code changes.\n",
      "Once a change is peer reviewed and approved, it is checked into a build, along with other changes that are currently in the workstream’s deployment process.\n",
      "Each build is subject to security and static analysis testing to test for the presence of security vulnerabilities.\n",
      "Except for in specific scenarios, M365 environment change management processes require 100% testing pass rates prior to moving forward in the deployment process.\n",
      "When a build successfully completes security testing, it is deployed to preproduction environments for integration testing.\n",
      "Builds can be independently deployed to the preproduction environments or multiple builds can be aggregated into a “release,” which is subject to integration testing.\n",
      "Code that has successfully completed all testing types is then deployed to the master code repository and is recognized as the newest version of the workstream’s source code.\n",
      "There are generally three types of preproduction environments, or “rings,” for ring validation integration testing:\n",
      "• DogFood: The workstream’s initial test ring consisting of a subset of Microsoft employees and customers who test changes on Microsoft’s behalf.\n",
      "• MSIT: The MSIT ring allows the release to be subject to testing by all Microsoft employees.\n",
      "• Slice in Production (SIP): Once the release is successfully integrated into the MSIT ring, it is moved into the SIP environment, which consists of about 5% worldwide customers who have decided to opt in and are able to provide feedback.\n",
      "Certain types of changes in M365 change management systems are subject to additional review and approval processes dependent on the nature of the change.\n",
      "The four approval levels based on the nature and impact of the change have been included below:\n",
      "• Auto-approval – A set of preapproved, low-risk standard changes.\n",
      "• Functional (Peer) Approval – Standard changes with a slightly higher level of risk.\n",
      "• Change Advisory Board Approval – Changes with the potential for high risk and high impact.\n",
      "• Emergency Change Advisory Board Approval – A risk that must be remediated timely, such as an out of band security patch.\n",
      "M365 service teams use a variety of tools to deploy changes to Azure.\n",
      "The ability to deploy code is restricted to appropriate build deployers using a combination of IDM, Torus, and Lockbox permissions.\n",
      "Security Development Lifecycle\n",
      "M365 environments follow the standard Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) process which includes, at a minimum, risk assessment, testing, approval, and documentation.\n",
      "The SDL process includes security development requirements, which are intended to reduce the number of security-related bugs that appear in the design, code, and documentation associated with a software release, as well as to detect and remove those bugs as early in the SDL as possible.\n",
      "Risk assessment and design review occurs in a Change Advisory Board entitled “Office Hours” whose members formally “Approve” or “Deny” any major or significant change prior to implementation.\n",
      "Members include representatives from Compliance, Security, and Microsoft Legal teams.\n",
      "Testing, including code reviews, occurs during the development and build processes.\n",
      "Results of the tests, reviews, and approvals are tracked through ticketing systems used by each team.\n",
      "These ticketing systems are listed in the Software section above.\n",
      "Data Redundancy\n",
      "Control Objective 3: Data redundancy controls exist to provide reasonable assurance that key information is replicated or backed up and can be restored in a timely manner.\n",
      "Data Replication and Data Redundancy\n",
      "Data for customer content, applications and support services is replicated for redundancy and disaster recovery purposes.\n",
      "M365 applications and supporting services are generally replicated from the primary content database to a secondary content database within the same primary datacenter.\n",
      "The primary and secondary databases are then replicated across geographically dispersed datacenters.\n",
      "Generally, the data maintained in the primary content database is replicated and accessible in real time via: (1) the primary database; (2) a secondary replication database located in the same primary datacenter with real time data; (3) a secondary disaster recovery server with real time replicated data in a geographically segregated datacenter; or (4) a server with a few minutes lag replication in a geographically dispersed datacenter.\n",
      "Data is accessible for redundancy and disaster recovery purposes for applications and support services through the data replication process described above, to meet the SLA requirements.\n",
      "It should be noted that the replication process described above reflects the processes in place for the EXO and SPO systems at an overall level.\n",
      "The supporting service teams perform similar replication processes, such as utilizing an Active-Active (e.g., EOP) replication process, but do not maintain lag copies of data.\n",
      "Azure based services rely on Azure capabilities for geo-redundant replication and storage.\n",
      "Business Continuity\n",
      "The majority of M365 service teams participate in the Enterprise Business Continuity Management (EBCM) program that uses a common set of criteria to determine the relevancy and frequency of failover exercises.\n",
      "Teams not yet integrated into the EBCM process perform periodic failover testing.\n",
      "Where relevant, failover exercises are conducted on a regular basis to test applications and related data to verify the accessibility at a secondary disaster recovery location.\n",
      "The frequency of conducting failover exercises, as well as the recovery time objectives (RTOs) for each application and support service, are based on the nature and criticality of the systems.\n",
      "The RTOs are developed as part of the overall M365 Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Planning.\n",
      "The primary objective of conducting failover exercises is to test whether the RTOs may be met in case of a disaster.\n",
      "Issues identified as part of the failover tests are tracked to ultimate resolution.\n",
      "Customer Termination\n",
      "Customer content is retained after termination of M365 subscriptions per agreed upon commitments with the customer in the contract and SLAs.\n",
      "Customers are responsible for the upload/download and management of data stored within the M365 environments related to confidentiality.\n",
      "Monitoring and Incident Management\n",
      "Control Objective 4: The security of the environment is monitored to provide reasonable assurance that security vulnerabilities are detected and remediated.\n",
      "Vulnerability and Patch Management\n",
      "The M365 Security team monitors for known configuration and patching vulnerabilities through automated scans based on Qualys technology.\n",
      "A master server is configured to scan each server across the M365 applications and supporting services suite to analyze and report known vulnerabilities and patch non-compliance.\n",
      "Each service team reviews the vulnerability scan report from the master server and assesses the criticality of the vulnerabilities and applies patches as applicable.\n",
      "New vulnerabilities (e.g., those from responsible disclosure programs) are communicated to M365 through the Microsoft Security Response Center.\n",
      "If a patch is developed for the vulnerability, each service team evaluates the relevance of the patch to its environment and applies the patch as applicable.\n",
      "Security Incident Monitoring\n",
      "M365 has implemented incident response procedures, which consist of technical mechanisms, organizational infrastructure, and other procedures to detect, respond, and deter security incidents.\n",
      "The M365 incident management technical infrastructure includes monitoring systems for detecting and alerting M365 personnel of security events and incidents.\n",
      "A monitoring agent is installed on each server at the time of server build-out to transfer the security logs to the Security Incident Response (SIR) team, which identifies potential incidents and serves as a central repository for investigations.\n",
      "Incidents posing significant risk to the environment are prioritized for response and mitigation.\n",
      "Additionally, each service team has on-call personnel covering a 24/7 schedule.\n",
      "If an incident is assigned a high enough severity, applicable contingency plans are invoked.\n",
      "When a contingency plan is invoked, the incident manager on shift works with the M365 Security team to implement the contingency plan.\n",
      "Server Build-Out Process\n",
      "M365 has a defined server build-out process to deploy and configure new servers and rebuild existing servers.\n",
      "As part of the server build-out process, each service team performs the following:\n",
      "• Connect the server to the specified domain.\n",
      "• Install antimalware agents to get up to date antimalware signature files and definitions.\n",
      "• Install a server agent to collect server activities and upload the logs to the Security Incident Response (SIR) team databases for security assessment activities.\n",
      "After the base server image is applied and the related build-out process is finished, quality assurance reviews are conducted to validate that the server build-out process completed as expected.\n",
      "The quality assurance review follows a process for server build-out compliance:\n",
      "• Automated build-out tool:\n",
      "Application and supporting service teams that leverage an automated build-out and deployment process utilize a scan performed by the deployment tool to substantiate the build had completed successfully.\n",
      "If there is a failure, the tool attempts to redeploy the build until successful.\n",
      "Certain services leverage Microsoft’s Azure PaaS offerings for server build-out and management.\n",
      "Teams who use Azure IaaS with customized server images maintain, update, and test server images as part of the deployment process.\n",
      "Once the server image has been tested, it is provided to Azure for actual deployment.\n",
      "Control Objectives and Related Control Activities\n",
      "The control objectives and related control activities are documented in Section 4 to reduce the redundancy that would result from listing them in this section and repeating them in Section 4.\n",
      "The control objectives and related control activities are however an integral part of the description of the system.\n",
      "While listed in Section 4, the service organization remains responsible for the representations in the description of controls.\n",

      "Overview Background Checks\n",
      "Backgrounds checks are required and renewed every 2 years for all full-time employees and vendors internationally, as permitted by the laws of each country, before access is granted to certain eligibilities within each workstream.\n",
      "Microsoft full-time employees request background checks, when necessary, through the OSP employee portal.\n",
      "A notification is sent to the requesting employee’s manager for approval.\n",
      "If approved, a notification email is sent to Microsoft HR to process a background check for the requesting employee.\n",
      "When the background check is complete, HR enters the results into SAP.\n",
      "For vendors and contractors, vendor companies are responsible for completing a valid background check for each contracted vendor.\n",
      "Once completed, Microsoft receives an attestation letter from the vendor company confirming the completion and pass status of the vendor’s background check.\n",
      "Once the background check validation is received, Microsoft enters relevant information into SAP through the ECS interface.\n",
      "Background check information for FTEs and vendors is pushed from SAP to an IDM database, after which the IDM tool checks for employee background check information before access to M365 cloud environments can be requested by the employee.\n",
      "Full and incremental sync jobs run to keep the data used by the IDM tool current.\n",
      "Service administrators configure requirements, including background check, for eligibilities within each workstream.\n",
      "If no background check is on file, or if a background check has expired, the user receives an error indicating that the employee does not have required background check, thus preventing the employee or vendor from obtaining those eligibilities.\n",
      "Identity Access Management\n",
      "Microsoft 365 owns and manages tools that regulate access to M365 production environments.\n",
      "Most service teams use the IDM access management service to limit access to authorized users.\n",
      "The service, managed by the Access Control team, allows each of the other service teams to manage their respective AD clusters for their respective environment.\n",
      "Several backend processes synchronize with other internal Microsoft tools, such as Microsoft HR department systems, to check that user information (e.g., employment status, manager, cost center, background check information) meets predefined requirements.\n",
      "Users who meet predefined criteria can request access to certain eligibilities, and access is only granted after approval.\n",
      "Some access is regulated outside the IDM service via other tools and processes; however, the functionality and processes are the same.\n",
      "These tools include IDWeb and OneIdentity.\n",
      "New User or Modification of User Access\n",
      "The process to request and approve new access via access management tools is managed through automated workflows configured within the tools.\n",
      "The systems automatically route access requests to the requestor’s manager for approval.\n",
      "Users who meet specified requirements (e.g. active user, active manager, applicable cost center, or background check) can request specific access to rights within each environment.\n",
      "User requests trigger notifications to the user’s manager via email of a pending access request requiring manager approval.\n",
      "No access is provisioned within production environments until manager approval is obtained.\n",
      "There are certain groups, roles, or entitlements that fall outside the automated provisioning processes described above.\n",
      "In each case users must still submit access requests, and each request must be approved before the access is manually provisioned.\n",
      "External Users (Customer Entities) – When a new customer is added to the M365 service, they are provided with an initial account for system setup.\n",
      "The provisioning of users and deactivation of users is the responsibility of the customer entity.\n",
      "Termination Access Removal\n",
      "When individuals leave the company, Microsoft HR updates the terminated employee’s details in the HR system, which syncs to access management tools via backend tasks.\n",
      "Access for terminated employees is then removed from respective service production environments.\n",
      "Without the appropriate entitlements, the user cannot access services within the M365 environment.\n",
      "Periodic User Access Review\n",
      "Services using the automated access provisioning processes above rely on workflows within the systems to automatically revoke user access based on the following criteria:\n",
      "• Inactivity - after 56 days of inactivity, the user’s account is disabled.\n",
      "• Manager Change - when a user’s manager and/or cost center has changed, users must re-request access using the same process described above, and the new manager must approve the user’s requested access.\n",
      "• Group Pre-defined Expiration - where applicable, services have security groups that have a set expiration period from when an account was granted access to the group.\n",
      "Periodic reviews, both manual and automated, are conducted to verify that each user’s access remains relevant and aligns with their job responsibilities.\n",
      "Some of these reviews use the automated M365 UAR Tool, while others are tracked manually by the services.\n",
      "Just-in-Time Access\n",
      "Just-in-time (JIT) tools allow individuals to request temporary elevated access privileges on an as-needed basis to limited areas within the respective service team’s associated production environments.\n",
      "Each tool follows a similar process before granting temporary elevated access to requesting engineers.\n",
      "Automated configurations within each tool notify the submitting user’s manager with details of the access requested.\n",
      "If approved, the requesting user is granted access on a temporary basis, and the tool automatically removes the requested access based on built-in functionality within the tool.\n",
      "In certain cases, an engineer may receive a one-time preapproval for access elevations to specific areas within an environment; however, the access is still temporary in duration.\n",
      "Additionally, each elevation is logged and retained by the service team for incident evaluations.\n",
      "Developer/Operations Model - Developer Access to Production\n",
      "Using the Access tools described above the service teams have restricted access to appropriate personnel, including the enforcement of segregation between developers and operations personnel.\n",
      "Select service teams allow developers temporary access to production using the JIT tools and approval processes described above.\n",
      "Developer access is limited to specific areas of the environment for deployment or operations purposes.\n",
      "These limitations are enforced using Torus, a Remote PowerShell tool.\n",
      "Torus allows for the restriction of access to specific commands that can be run in the service team’s environment and requires approvals for each command being requested.\n",
      "The Torus request and approval process is managed by the JIT tools described above.\n",
      "For requests to make changes to production code or data by a developer or operator, an associated deployment request ticket must be provided and approved by a separate individual.\n",
      "Authentication\n",
      "Internal users are authenticated using Remote Desktop Services and must be authenticated using a two-factor authentication mechanism that includes a smartcard with PIN to log into the RDG.\n",
      "After logging in to the RDG, the user must enter his/her production account user ID and password to access production servers.\n",
      "The corporate password requirements are defined and configured within code and passwords are automatically generated.\n",
      "These requirements include password complexity, length, history, and duration.\n",
      "Additionally, internal users can gain temporary access to elevated roles allowing access to customer content via the JIT methods described above.\n",
      "For those services that only use JIT elevations to access the environment with no standing access, there are requirements built into the JIT tools for generating onetime complex passwords for authenticating into these environments.\n",
      "External Users – Microsoft provides various options to enable the authentication mechanism for end users and M365 customers.\n",
      "Each external entity is responsible for substantiating that the mechanism is configured and operating, as well as enforcing the use of strong passwords.\n",
      "Data Management Data Segregation\n",
      "Customer content is stored and processed on a shared database which is logically segregated using program logic and a different customer identifier.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox\n",
      "Control Objective 5: Controls provide reasonable assurance that customer content is only accessed when authorized by a designated customer account administrator.\n",
      "For customers utilizing the Customer Lockbox feature, Customer Lockbox is an access control technology included in M365, designed to provide customer control and transparency over access to customer content hosted in Microsoft datacenters.\n",
      "The service grants Microsoft engineers temporary access to customer content on as- needed basis only as approved by an appropriate tenant authority.\n",
      "The following sections, prefixed with “Customer Lockbox,” detail the procedures in place to limit Microsoft access to customer generated content.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Authorization and Notification\n",
      "Access to customer content for customers utilizing the Customer Lockbox feature is initiated through a Service Request made via Microsoft’s customer support.\n",
      "If the Service Request requires access to customer content, the access is requested through the Customer Lockbox tool.\n",
      "Individuals who are approved to access the customer content do so using the Remote PowerShell (RPS) tool.\n",
      "Only Microsoft engineers with appropriate access entitlements within the Exchange environment, can request temporary elevation to the ‘AccessToCustomerData’ role, which allows access to customer content.\n",
      "The request process is built into Customer Lockbox.\n",
      "If approved by the role owners, Microsoft managers, the request is then routed to a customer contact for additional approval.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Customer Approval\n",
      "The automated workflows supporting the Customer Lockbox elevation process require that elevation requests are first approved by Microsoft management before being submitted to a tenant administrator.\n",
      "Tenant administrators are assigned and are the responsibility of each customer.\n",
      "If the request is not approved within a specified period of time by both the Microsoft management and the tenant administrator, then the elevation request times out and becomes invalid.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Associated Service Request\n",
      "Each elevation request made using Customer Lockbox must reference an associated service request number before submission to Microsoft management for approval.\n",
      "Attempts to submit an elevation request without an associated service request number will fail, and the RPS tool will return an error.\n",

      "Customer Lockbox - Microsoft 365 Admin Center\n",
      "M365 customers can review a history of Customer Lockbox elevation requests within the customer’s M365 Admin Center.\n",
      "The history includes relevant information for current and past elevation requests, including the date, service request number, duration of elevation, reason for elevation, and requestor.\n",
      "The logs are kept for a reasonable period of time.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Searchable Audit Logs\n",
      "Server activity is logged for each Customer Lockbox elevation, and the activity log repository is available to each Customer Lockbox customer.\n",

      "Customer Lockbox - Management Review of Elevations\n",
      "Microsoft management pulls logs of Customer Lockbox elevations, as well as capacity server administrator elevations, from a data repository and investigates any anomalies.\n",
      "Any anomalies identified are discussed and actioned in a weekly service review.\n",
      "The statistics are aggregated and reviewed annually with Microsoft management.\n",
      "For customers who have chosen to use Customer Lockbox, it is the only way to access customer content.\n",
      "Any other access paths are considered malicious access and are not covered by this attestation.\n",
      "Service Encryption with Customer Key in Microsoft 365\n",
      "Control Objective 6: Controls provide reasonable assurance customer mailboxes are encrypted using customer keys, data that is deleted per request is no longer accessible, and customers data is isolated to those with access to the appropriate customer key.\n",
      "For customers utilizing the Service Encryption with Customer Key feature, Microsoft 365 provides customers with two application level encryption options for their data within Exchange and SharePoint service: 1) Service Encryption with Microsoft owned encryption keys, and 2) Service Encryption with customer-owned keys (“Customer Keys”).\n",
      "In the standard Microsoft Service Encryption described above, M365 owns the encryption keys for the customer’s Exchange mailboxes and SharePoint sites.\n",
      "Service Encryption with Customer Key (“Customer Key”) is an opt-in encryption offering that allows M365 customers to supply and manage their own encryption keys for advanced, self-managed protection.\n",
      "The Customer Key offering is available in both the Exchange Online Worldwide, GCC-M, GCC-H, Department of Defense environment, as well as the SharePoint Online Worldwide environment.\n",
      "Each “Customer Key” subscription a customer maintains has its own service tenant encryption identifier, and two corresponding Azure-hosted customer key vaults.\n",
      "The customer keys are housed in Azure Key Vault; the onboarding process is inclusive of an Azure subscription creation, which customers will then use to house their keys which correspond with their “Customer Key” service.\n",
      "The two respective Azure Key Vaults each maintain a unique encryption key provided by the customer during the “Customer Key” onboarding process.\n",
      "For EXO: The “Customer Key” model can be applied to all users within a customer’s AD environment or can be segregated based on customer preferred user groupings or business unit differentiations.\n",
      "Each respective Exchange “Customer Key” subscription instance maintains its own Data Encryption Policy (“DEP”) that must be configured by the customer admin during the onboarding process as well.\n",
      "Once a DEP has been created, the customer can provision AD user mailboxes to that DEP, applying that encryption policy to the user mailboxes provisioned to that Customer Key DEP.\n",
      "For SPO: The Customer Key model is applied at the tenant level via Tenant Intermediate Keys \"TIKs\"; if a customer opts-in to Customer Key, all SharePoint site instances are encrypted at the application layer.\n",
      "Customer mailboxes or SharePoint sites associated with a Customer Key DEP or TIK are only accessible through utilizing the customer root keys relevant to each encryption policy type, which are stored in Azure Key Vault.\n",
      "Through Azure, Microsoft maintains its own interim keys, but an interim key does not have the ability to decrypt customer data.\n",
      "Under rare circumstances, Microsoft may need to access resources with customer content to perform specific service oriented and maintenance tasks.\n",
      "To do this the service performs a customer key wrap operation, in which Microsoft’s interim key is sent to Azure blob storage to be wrapped with a data blob of the customer key.\n",
      "The Azure key wrap function does not allow Microsoft access to the unique customer root keys themselves; the interim keys are instead wrapped with the root key data for access purposes.\n",
      "Once retrieved, the Microsoft engineer can access resources with customer data to perform the relevant service tasks.\n",
      "Once the tasks are complete, an unwrap operation is performed, in which the wrapped interim key is sent to Azure blob storage to be unwrapped and consequently disassociated from the customer root key housed in Azure Key Vault.\n",
      "Unwrapped interim keys cannot access Customer Key encrypted data.\n",
      "Microsoft provides additional protections if the customer owned root keys are lost or stolen with an “Availability Key”, which provides M365 customers with the capability to recover from the unanticipated loss of root keys.\n",
      "Microsoft will either assist customers through this process or provide customers with instructions on how to recover without assistance from Microsoft.\n",
      "The Availability Key is a root key that is provisioned and protected by Microsoft and is functionally equivalent to the root keys that are supplied by the customer for use with service encryption with “Customer Key.”\n",
      "Because the Availability Key is protected by Microsoft, it uses a different security design and controls from keys that the customer manages.\n",
      "This provides defense-in-depth and protects against the loss of all keys from a single attack or point of failure.\n",
      "Sharing the responsibility to protect the keys, while using a variety of protections and processes for key management, ultimately reduces the risk that all keys will be lost or destroyed.\n",
      "Service Encryption with Customer Key in Microsoft 365 – Termination\n",
      "Customers can opt out of the Service Encryption with Customer Key service.\n",
      "For EXO, customers can revoke root key access, either through group divestiture at a DEP level or through full-service exit.\n",
      "Since the TIK applies to all SharePoint instances, opting out of the Customer Key service consequently applies to all of the tenant’s SharePoint instances.\n",
      "When a tenant wishes to opt-out of the Service Encryption with Customer Key service, the Exchange and SharePoint tenant administrators must confirm that the customer is truly opting out of the service and wants the data to be deleted.\n",
      "Once a customer opts-out of the service, deletes their own root keys, and signs the eDocument stating their service termination, Microsoft locks the customer out of their data as a confirmation step that the tenant would truly like that data to be deleted.\n",
      "Once this step has been taken, the customer’s executive team must formally communicate the opt-out decision on behalf of the customer via signed and notarized documentation.\n",
      "Microsoft will maintain their root key to the customer’s data until the executive confirmation of service termination has been received, or the 90- to 180-day deletion period threshold has been reached.\n",
      "Once the customer service termination confirmation has been communicated, the customer can request that Microsoft delete its root key access to the data in question.\n",
      "Change Management\n",
      "Control Objective 2: Changes to application programs and related data management systems are authorized, tested, documented, approved, and implemented consistent with management’s intentions.\n",
      "Service Infrastructure and Support Systems Change Management\n",
      "Service- and support-related changes follow an established change management process for the M365 environment.\n",
      "Each change is tracked within identified ticketing systems, which contain information that can be linked to approval and testing details related to the change.\n",
      "These ticketing systems are listed in the Software section above.\n",
      "Appropriate authorizations and approvals needed for the changes being made to these environments are defined in the tickets.\n",
      "When service teams or customer representatives enter a request for a change to the M365 environment in the change management systems, a representative of the relevant workstream is charged with addressing the change request.\n",
      "If a code modification is required, the addressor will perform a pull request, which replicates the master branch’s code and allows the user to perform necessary code modifications without disrupting the live code running in production.\n",
      "Each individual change or addition made to address the change request is subject to a peer review in which another workstream representative reviews and approves the individual code changes.\n",
      "Once a change is peer reviewed and approved, it is checked into a build, along with other changes that are currently in the workstream’s deployment process.\n",
      "Each build is subject to security and static analysis testing to test for the presence of security vulnerabilities.\n",
      "Except for in specific scenarios, M365 environment change management processes require 100% testing pass rates prior to moving forward in the deployment process.\n",
      "When a build successfully completes security testing, it is deployed to preproduction environments for integration testing.\n",
      "Builds can be independently deployed to the preproduction environments or multiple builds can be aggregated into a “release,” which is subject to integration testing.\n",
      "Code that has successfully completed all testing types is then deployed to the master code repository and is recognized as the newest version of the workstream’s source code.\n",
      "There are generally three types of preproduction environments, or “rings,” for ring validation integration testing:\n",
      "• DogFood: The workstream’s initial test ring consisting of a subset of Microsoft employees and customers who test changes on Microsoft’s behalf.\n",
      "• MSIT: The MSIT ring allows the release to be subject to testing by all Microsoft employees.\n",
      "• Slice in Production (SIP): Once the release is successfully integrated into the MSIT ring, it is moved into the SIP environment, which consists of about 5% worldwide customers who have decided to opt in and are able to provide feedback.\n",
      "Certain types of changes in M365 change management systems are subject to additional review and approval processes dependent on the nature of the change.\n",
      "The four approval levels based on the nature and impact of the change have been included below:\n",
      "• Auto-approval – A set of preapproved, low-risk standard changes.\n",
      "• Functional (Peer) Approval – Standard changes with a slightly higher level of risk.\n",
      "• Change Advisory Board Approval – Changes with the potential for high risk and high impact.\n",
      "• Emergency Change Advisory Board Approval – A risk that must be remediated timely, such as an out of band security patch.\n",
      "M365 service teams use a variety of tools to deploy changes to Azure.\n",
      "The ability to deploy code is restricted to appropriate build deployers using a combination of IDM, Torus, and Lockbox permissions.\n",
      "Security Development Lifecycle\n",
      "M365 environments follow the standard Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) process which includes, at a minimum, risk assessment, testing, approval, and documentation.\n",
      "The SDL process includes security development requirements, which are intended to reduce the number of security-related bugs that appear in the design, code, and documentation associated with a software release, as well as to detect and remove those bugs as early in the SDL as possible.\n",
      "Risk assessment and design review occurs in a Change Advisory Board entitled “Office Hours” whose members formally “Approve” or “Deny” any major or significant change prior to implementation.\n",
      "Members include representatives from Compliance, Security, and Microsoft Legal teams.\n",
      "Testing, including code reviews, occurs during the development and build processes.\n",
      "Results of the tests, reviews, and approvals are tracked through ticketing systems used by each team.\n",
      "These ticketing systems are listed in the Software section above.\n",
      "Data Redundancy\n",
      "Control Objective 3: Data redundancy controls exist to provide reasonable assurance that key information is replicated or backed up and can be restored in a timely manner.\n",
      "Data Replication and Data Redundancy\n",
      "Data for customer content, applications and support services is replicated for redundancy and disaster recovery purposes.\n",
      "M365 applications and supporting services are generally replicated from the primary content database to a secondary content database within the same primary datacenter.\n",
      "The primary and secondary databases are then replicated across geographically dispersed datacenters.\n",
      "Generally, the data maintained in the primary content database is replicated and accessible in real time via: (1) the primary database; (2) a secondary replication database located in the same primary datacenter with real time data; (3) a secondary disaster recovery server with real time replicated data in a geographically segregated datacenter; or (4) a server with a few minutes lag replication in a geographically dispersed datacenter.\n",
      "Data is accessible for redundancy and disaster recovery purposes for applications and support services through the data replication process described above, to meet the SLA requirements.\n",
      "It should be noted that the replication process described above reflects the processes in place for the EXO and SPO systems at an overall level.\n",
      "The supporting service teams perform similar replication processes, such as utilizing an Active-Active (e.g., EOP) replication process, but do not maintain lag copies of data.\n",
      "Azure based services rely on Azure capabilities for geo-redundant replication and storage.\n",
      "Business Continuity\n",
      "The majority of M365 service teams participate in the Enterprise Business Continuity Management (EBCM) program that uses a common set of criteria to determine the relevancy and frequency of failover exercises.\n",
      "Teams not yet integrated into the EBCM process perform periodic failover testing.\n",
      "Where relevant, failover exercises are conducted on a regular basis to test applications and related data to verify the accessibility at a secondary disaster recovery location.\n",
      "The frequency of conducting failover exercises, as well as the recovery time objectives (RTOs) for each application and support service, are based on the nature and criticality of the systems.\n",
      "The RTOs are developed as part of the overall M365 Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Planning.\n",
      "The primary objective of conducting failover exercises is to test whether the RTOs may be met in case of a disaster.\n",
      "Issues identified as part of the failover tests are tracked to ultimate resolution.\n",
      "Customer Termination\n",
      "Customer content is retained after termination of M365 subscriptions per agreed upon commitments with the customer in the contract and SLAs.\n",
      "Customers are responsible for the upload/download and management of data stored within the M365 environments related to confidentiality.\n",
      "Monitoring and Incident Management\n",
      "Control Objective 4: The security of the environment is monitored to provide reasonable assurance that security vulnerabilities are detected and remediated.\n",
      "Vulnerability and Patch Management\n",
      "The M365 Security team monitors for known configuration and patching vulnerabilities through automated scans based on Qualys technology.\n",
      "A master server is configured to scan each server across the M365 applications and supporting services suite to analyze and report known vulnerabilities and patch non-compliance.\n",
      "Each service team reviews the vulnerability scan report from the master server and assesses the criticality of the vulnerabilities and applies patches as applicable.\n",
      "New vulnerabilities (e.g., those from responsible disclosure programs) are communicated to M365 through the Microsoft Security Response Center.\n",
      "If a patch is developed for the vulnerability, each service team evaluates the relevance of the patch to its environment and applies the patch as applicable.\n",
      "Security Incident Monitoring\n",
      "M365 has implemented incident response procedures, which consist of technical mechanisms, organizational infrastructure, and other procedures to detect, respond, and deter security incidents.\n",
      "The M365 incident management technical infrastructure includes monitoring systems for detecting and alerting M365 personnel of security events and incidents.\n",
      "A monitoring agent is installed on each server at the time of server build-out to transfer the security logs to the Security Incident Response (SIR) team, which identifies potential incidents and serves as a central repository for investigations.\n",
      "Incidents posing significant risk to the environment are prioritized for response and mitigation.\n",
      "Additionally, each service team has on-call personnel covering a 24/7 schedule.\n",
      "If an incident is assigned a high enough severity, applicable contingency plans are invoked.\n",
      "When a contingency plan is invoked, the incident manager on shift works with the M365 Security team to implement the contingency plan.\n",
      "Server Build-Out Process\n",
      "M365 has a defined server build-out process to deploy and configure new servers and rebuild existing servers.\n",
      "As part of the server build-out process, each service team performs the following:\n",
      "• Connect the server to the specified domain.\n",
      "• Install antimalware agents to get up to date antimalware signature files and definitions.\n",
      "• Install a server agent to collect server activities and upload the logs to the Security Incident Response (SIR) team databases for security assessment activities.\n",
      "After the base server image is applied and the related build-out process is finished, quality assurance reviews are conducted to validate that the server build-out process completed as expected.\n",
      "The quality assurance review follows a process for server build-out compliance:\n",
      "• Automated build-out tool:\n",
      "Application and supporting service teams that leverage an automated build-out and deployment process utilize a scan performed by the deployment tool to substantiate the build had completed successfully.\n",
      "If there is a failure, the tool attempts to redeploy the build until successful.\n",
      "Certain services leverage Microsoft’s Azure PaaS offerings for server build-out and management.\n",
      "Teams who use Azure IaaS with customized server images maintain, update, and test server images as part of the deployment process.\n",
      "Once the server image has been tested, it is provided to Azure for actual deployment.\n",
      "Control Objectives and Related Control Activities\n",
      "The control objectives and related control activities are documented in Section 4 to reduce the redundancy that would result from listing them in this section and repeating them in Section 4.\n",
      "The control objectives and related control activities are however an integral part of the description of the system.\n",
      "While listed in Section 4, the service organization remains responsible for the representations in the description of controls.\n",

      "Deloitte & Touche LLP performed a variety of tests relating to the controls listed in this section throughout the period from October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024.\n",
      "Our tests of controls were performed on controls as they existed during the period of October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024, and were applied to those controls specified by Microsoft.\n",
      "In determining the nature, timing, and extent of tests, we considered (a) the nature and frequency of the controls being tested, (b) the types of available evidential matter, (c) the assessed level of control risk, (d) the expected effectiveness of the test, and (e) our understanding of the control environment.\n",
      "In addition to the tests listed below, we ascertained through multiple inquiries with management and the control owner that each control activity listed below operated as described throughout the period.\n",
      "Tests performed are described below:\n",
      " | Test | Description\n",
      " | Corroborative Inquiry | Conducted detailed interviews with relevant personnel to obtain evidence that the control was in operation during the report period and is accompanied by other procedures noted below that are necessary to corroborate the information derived from the inquiry.\n",
      " | Observation | Observed the performance of the control during the report period to evidence application of the specific control activity.\n",
      " | Examination of documentation/Inspection | If the performance of the control is documented, inspected documents and reports indicating performance of the control.\n",
      " | Reperformance of monitoring activities or manual controls | Obtained documents used in the monitoring activity or manual control activity, independently reperformed the procedures, and compared any discrepancies identified with those identified by the responsible control owner.\n",

      "Logical Access\n",
      "Control Objective 1: Logical access controls exist to provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized access to key systems is restricted.\n",
      "Overview Background Checks\n",
      "Backgrounds checks are required and renewed every 2 years for all full-time employees and vendors internationally, as permitted by the laws of each country, before access is granted to certain eligibilities within each workstream.\n",
      "Microsoft full-time employees request background checks, when necessary, through the OSP employee portal.\n",
      "A notification is sent to the requesting employee’s manager for approval.\n",
      "If approved, a notification email is sent to Microsoft HR to process a background check for the requesting employee.\n",
      "When the background check is complete, HR enters the results into SAP.\n",
      "For vendors and contractors, vendor companies are responsible for completing a valid background check for each contracted vendor.\n",
      "Once completed, Microsoft receives an attestation letter from the vendor company confirming the completion and pass status of the vendor’s background check.\n",
      "Once the background check validation is received, Microsoft enters relevant information into SAP through the ECS interface.\n",
      "Background check information for FTEs and vendors is pushed from SAP to an IDM database, after which the IDM tool checks for employee background check information before access to M365 cloud environments can be requested by the employee.\n",
      "Full and incremental sync jobs run to keep the data used by the IDM tool current.\n",
      "Service administrators configure requirements, including background check, for eligibilities within each workstream.\n",
      "If no background check is on file, or if a background check has expired, the user receives an error indicating that the employee does not have required background check, thus preventing the employee or vendor from obtaining those eligibilities.\n",
      "Identity Access Management\n",
      "Microsoft 365 owns and manages tools that regulate access to M365 production environments.\n",
      "Most service teams use the IDM access management service to limit access to authorized users.\n",
      "The service, managed by the Access Control team, allows each of the other service teams to manage their respective AD clusters for their respective environment.\n",
      "Several backend processes synchronize with other internal Microsoft tools, such as Microsoft HR department systems, to check that user information (e.g., employment status, manager, cost center, background check information) meets predefined requirements.\n",
      "Users who meet predefined criteria can request access to certain eligibilities, and access is only granted after approval.\n",
      "Some access is regulated outside the IDM service via other tools and processes; however, the functionality and processes are the same.\n",
      "These tools include IDWeb and OneIdentity.\n",
      "New User or Modification of User Access\n",
      "The process to request and approve new access via access management tools is managed through automated workflows configured within the tools.\n",
      "The systems automatically route access requests to the requestor’s manager for approval.\n",
      "Users who meet specified requirements (e.g. active user, active manager, applicable cost center, or background check) can request specific access to rights within each environment.\n",
      "User requests trigger notifications to the user’s manager via email of a pending access request requiring manager approval.\n",
      "No access is provisioned within production environments until manager approval is obtained.\n",
      "There are certain groups, roles, or entitlements that fall outside the automated provisioning processes described above.\n",
      "In each case users must still submit access requests, and each request must be approved before the access is manually provisioned.\n",
      "External Users (Customer Entities) – When a new customer is added to the M365 service, they are provided with an initial account for system setup.\n",
      "The provisioning of users and deactivation of users is the responsibility of the customer entity.\n",
      "Termination Access Removal\n",
      "When individuals leave the company, Microsoft HR updates the terminated employee’s details in the HR system, which syncs to access management tools via backend tasks.\n",
      "Access for terminated employees is then removed from respective service production environments.\n",
      "Without the appropriate entitlements, the user cannot access services within the M365 environment.\n",
      "Periodic User Access Review\n",
      "Services using the automated access provisioning processes above rely on workflows within the systems to automatically revoke user access based on the following criteria:\n",
      "• Inactivity - after 56 days of inactivity, the user’s account is disabled.\n",
      "• Manager Change - when a user’s manager and/or cost center has changed, users must re-request access using the same process described above, and the new manager must approve the user’s requested access.\n",
      "• Group Pre-defined Expiration - where applicable, services have security groups that have a set expiration period from when an account was granted access to the group.\n",
      "Periodic reviews, both manual and automated, are conducted to verify that each user’s access remains relevant and aligns with their job responsibilities.\n",
      "Some of these reviews use the automated M365 UAR Tool, while others are tracked manually by the services.\n",
      "Just-in-Time Access\n",
      "Just-in-time (JIT) tools allow individuals to request temporary elevated access privileges on an as-needed basis to limited areas within the respective service team’s associated production environments.\n",
      "Each tool follows a similar process before granting temporary elevated access to requesting engineers.\n",
      "Automated configurations within each tool notify the submitting user’s manager with details of the access requested.\n",
      "If approved, the requesting user is granted access on a temporary basis, and the tool automatically removes the requested access based on built-in functionality within the tool.\n",
      "In certain cases, an engineer may receive a one-time preapproval for access elevations to specific areas within an environment; however, the access is still temporary in duration.\n",
      "Additionally, each elevation is logged and retained by the service team for incident evaluations.\n",
      "Developer/Operations Model - Developer Access to Production\n",
      "Using the Access tools described above the service teams have restricted access to appropriate personnel, including the enforcement of segregation between developers and operations personnel.\n",
      "Select service teams allow developers temporary access to production using the JIT tools and approval processes described above.\n",
      "Developer access is limited to specific areas of the environment for deployment or operations purposes.\n",
      "These limitations are enforced using Torus, a Remote PowerShell tool.\n",
      "Torus allows for the restriction of access to specific commands that can be run in the service team’s environment and requires approvals for each command being requested.\n",
      "The Torus request and approval process is managed by the JIT tools described above.\n",
      "For requests to make changes to production code or data by a developer or operator, an associated deployment request ticket must be provided and approved by a separate individual.\n",
      "Authentication\n",
      "Internal users are authenticated using Remote Desktop Services and must be authenticated using a two-factor authentication mechanism that includes a smartcard with PIN to log into the RDG.\n",
      "After logging in to the RDG, the user must enter his/her production account user ID and password to access production servers.\n",
      "The corporate password requirements are defined and configured within code and passwords are automatically generated.\n",
      "These requirements include password complexity, length, history, and duration.\n",
      "Additionally, internal users can gain temporary access to elevated roles allowing access to customer content via the JIT methods described above.\n",
      "For those services that only use JIT elevations to access the environment with no standing access, there are requirements built into the JIT tools for generating onetime complex passwords for authenticating into these environments.\n",
      "External Users – Microsoft provides various options to enable the authentication mechanism for end users and M365 customers.\n",
      "Each external entity is responsible for substantiating that the mechanism is configured and operating, as well as enforcing the use of strong passwords.\n",
      "Data Management Data Segregation\n",
      "Customer content is stored and processed on a shared database which is logically segregated using program logic and a different customer identifier.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox\n",
      "Control Objective 5: Controls provide reasonable assurance that customer content is only accessed when authorized by a designated customer account administrator.\n",
      "For customers utilizing the Customer Lockbox feature, Customer Lockbox is an access control technology included in M365, designed to provide customer control and transparency over access to customer content hosted in Microsoft datacenters.\n",
      "The service grants Microsoft engineers temporary access to customer content on as- needed basis only as approved by an appropriate tenant authority.\n",
      "The following sections, prefixed with “Customer Lockbox,” detail the procedures in place to limit Microsoft access to customer generated content.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Authorization and Notification\n",
      "Access to customer content for customers utilizing the Customer Lockbox feature is initiated through a Service Request made via Microsoft’s customer support.\n",
      "If the Service Request requires access to customer content, the access is requested through the Customer Lockbox tool.\n",
      "Individuals who are approved to access the customer content do so using the Remote PowerShell (RPS) tool.\n",
      "Only Microsoft engineers with appropriate access entitlements within the Exchange environment, can request temporary elevation to the ‘AccessToCustomerData’ role, which allows access to customer content.\n",
      "The request process is built into Customer Lockbox.\n",
      "If approved by the role owners, Microsoft managers, the request is then routed to a customer contact for additional approval.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Customer Approval\n",
      "The automated workflows supporting the Customer Lockbox elevation process require that elevation requests are first approved by Microsoft management before being submitted to a tenant administrator.\n",
      "Tenant administrators are assigned and are the responsibility of each customer.\n",
      "If the request is not approved within a specified period of time by both the Microsoft management and the tenant administrator, then the elevation request times out and becomes invalid.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Associated Service Request\n",
      "Each elevation request made using Customer Lockbox must reference an associated service request number before submission to Microsoft management for approval.\n",
      "Attempts to submit an elevation request without an associated service request number will fail, and the RPS tool will return an error.\n",
      "Service requests are either submitted by the effected customer or created and communicated to the customer prior to the elevation request.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Microsoft 365 Admin Center\n",
      "M365 customers can review a history of Customer Lockbox elevation requests within the customer’s M365 Admin Center.\n",
      "The history includes relevant information for current and past elevation requests, including the date, service request number, duration of elevation, reason for elevation, and requestor.\n",
      "The logs are kept for a reasonable period of time.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Searchable Audit Logs\n",
      "Server activity is logged for each Customer Lockbox elevation, and the activity log repository is available to each Customer Lockbox customer.\n",
      "Activity logs show what actions and commands were executed on a server containing customer content by a Microsoft engineer for the time allowed during an elevation requested through Customer Lockbox.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Management Review of Elevations\n",
      "Microsoft management pulls logs of Customer Lockbox elevations, as well as capacity server administrator elevations, from a data repository and investigates any anomalies.\n",
      "Any anomalies identified are discussed and actioned in a weekly service review.\n",
      "The statistics are aggregated and reviewed annually with Microsoft management.\n",
      "For customers who have chosen to use Customer Lockbox, it is the only way to access customer content.\n",
      "Any other access paths are considered malicious access and are not covered by this attestation.\n",
      "Service Encryption with Customer Key in Microsoft 365\n",
      "Control Objective 6: Controls provide reasonable assurance customer mailboxes are encrypted using customer keys, data that is deleted per request is no longer accessible, and customers data is isolated to those with access to the appropriate customer key.\n",
      "For customers utilizing the Service Encryption with Customer Key feature, Microsoft 365 provides customers with two application level encryption options for their data within Exchange and SharePoint service: 1) Service Encryption with Microsoft owned encryption keys, and 2) Service Encryption with customer-owned keys (“Customer Keys”).\n",
      "In the standard Microsoft Service Encryption described above, M365 owns the encryption keys for the customer’s Exchange mailboxes and SharePoint sites.\n",
      "Service Encryption with Customer Key (“Customer Key”) is an opt-in encryption offering that allows M365 customers to supply and manage their own encryption keys for advanced, self-managed protection.\n",
      "The Customer Key offering is available in both the Exchange Online Worldwide, GCC-M, GCC-H, Department of Defense environment, as well as the SharePoint Online Worldwide environment.\n",
      "Each “Customer Key” subscription a customer maintains has its own service tenant encryption identifier, and two corresponding Azure-hosted customer key vaults.\n",
      "The customer keys are housed in Azure Key Vault; the onboarding process is inclusive of an Azure subscription creation, which customers will then use to house their keys which correspond with their “Customer Key” service.\n",
      "The two respective Azure Key Vaults each maintain a unique encryption key provided by the customer during the “Customer Key” onboarding process.\n",
      "For EXO: The “Customer Key” model can be applied to all users within a customer’s AD environment or can be segregated based on customer preferred user groupings or business unit differentiations.\n",
      "Each respective Exchange “Customer Key” subscription instance maintains its own Data Encryption Policy (“DEP”) that must be configured by the customer admin during the onboarding process as well.\n",
      "Once a DEP has been created, the customer can provision AD user mailboxes to that DEP, applying that encryption policy to the user mailboxes provisioned to that Customer Key DEP.\n",
      "For SPO: The Customer Key model is applied at the tenant level via Tenant Intermediate Keys \"TIKs\"; if a customer opts-in to Customer Key, all SharePoint site instances are encrypted at the application layer.\n",
      "Customer mailboxes or SharePoint sites associated with a Customer Key DEP or TIK are only accessible through utilizing the customer root keys relevant to each encryption policy type, which are stored in Azure Key Vault.\n",
      "Through Azure, Microsoft maintains its own interim keys, but an interim key does not have the ability to decrypt customer data.\n",
      "Under rare circumstances, Microsoft may need to access resources with customer content to perform specific service oriented and maintenance tasks.\n",
      "To do this the service performs a customer key wrap operation, in which Microsoft’s interim key is sent to Azure blob storage to be wrapped with a data blob of the customer key.\n",
      "The Azure key wrap function does not allow Microsoft access to the unique customer root keys themselves; the interim keys are instead wrapped with the root key data for access purposes.\n",
      "Once retrieved, the Microsoft engineer can access resources with customer data to perform the relevant service tasks.\n",
      "Once the tasks are complete, an unwrap operation is performed, in which the wrapped interim key is sent to Azure blob storage to be unwrapped and consequently disassociated from the customer root key housed in Azure Key Vault.\n",
      "Unwrapped interim keys cannot access Customer Key encrypted data.\n",
      "Microsoft provides additional protections if the customer owned root keys are lost or stolen with an “Availability Key”, which provides M365 customers with the capability to recover from the unanticipated loss of root keys.\n",
      "Microsoft will either assist customers through this process or provide customers with instructions on how to recover without assistance from Microsoft.\n",
      "The Availability Key is a root key that is provisioned and protected by Microsoft and is functionally equivalent to the root keys that are supplied by the customer for use with service encryption with “Customer Key.”\n",
      "Because the Availability Key is protected by Microsoft, it uses a different security design and controls from keys that the customer manages.\n",
      "This provides defense-in-depth and protects against the loss of all keys from a single attack or point of failure.\n",
      "Sharing the responsibility to protect the keys, while using a variety of protections and processes for key management, ultimately reduces the risk that all keys will be lost or destroyed.\n",
      "Service Encryption with Customer Key in Microsoft 365 – Termination\n",
      "Customers can opt out of the Service Encryption with Customer Key service.\n",
      "For EXO, customers can revoke root key access, either through group divestiture at a DEP level or through full-service exit.\n",
      "Since the TIK applies to all SharePoint instances, opting out of the Customer Key service consequently applies to all of the tenant’s SharePoint instances.\n",
      "When a tenant wishes to opt-out of the Service Encryption with Customer Key service, the Exchange and SharePoint tenant administrators must confirm that the customer is truly opting out of the service and wants the data to be deleted.\n",
      "Once a customer opts-out of the service, deletes their own root keys, and signs the eDocument stating their service termination, Microsoft locks the customer out of their data as a confirmation step that the tenant would truly like that data to be deleted.\n",
      "Once this step has been taken, the customer’s executive team must formally communicate the opt-out decision on behalf of the customer via signed and notarized documentation.\n",
      "Microsoft will maintain their root key to the customer’s data until the executive confirmation of service termination has been received, or the 90- to 180-day deletion period threshold has been reached.\n",
      "Once the customer service termination confirmation has been communicated, the customer can request that Microsoft delete its root key access to the data in question.\n",
      "Change Management\n",
      "Control Objective 2: Changes to application programs and related data management systems are authorized, tested, documented, approved, and implemented consistent with management’s intentions.\n",
      "Service Infrastructure and Support Systems Change Management\n",
      "Service- and support-related changes follow an established change management process for the M365 environment.\n",
      "Each change is tracked within identified ticketing systems, which contain information that can be linked to approval and testing details related to the change.\n",
      "These ticketing systems are listed in the Software section above.\n",
      "Appropriate authorizations and approvals needed for the changes being made to these environments are defined in the tickets.\n",
      "When service teams or customer representatives enter a request for a change to the M365 environment in the change management systems, a representative of the relevant workstream is charged with addressing the change request.\n",
      "If a code modification is required, the addressor will perform a pull request, which replicates the master branch’s code and allows the user to perform necessary code modifications without disrupting the live code running in production.\n",
      "Each individual change or addition made to address the change request is subject to a peer review in which another workstream representative reviews and approves the individual code changes.\n",
      "Once a change is peer reviewed and approved, it is checked into a build, along with other changes that are currently in the workstream’s deployment process.\n",
      "Each build is subject to security and static analysis testing to test for the presence of security vulnerabilities.\n",
      "Except for in specific scenarios, M365 environment change management processes require 100% testing pass rates prior to moving forward in the deployment process.\n",
      "When a build successfully completes security testing, it is deployed to preproduction environments for integration testing.\n",
      "Builds can be independently deployed to the preproduction environments or multiple builds can be aggregated into a “release,” which is subject to integration testing.\n",
      "Code that has successfully completed all testing types is then deployed to the master code repository and is recognized as the newest version of the workstream’s source code.\n",
      "There are generally three types of preproduction environments, or “rings,” for ring validation integration testing:\n",
      "• DogFood: The workstream’s initial test ring consisting of a subset of Microsoft employees and customers who test changes on Microsoft’s behalf.\n",
      "• MSIT: The MSIT ring allows the release to be subject to testing by all Microsoft employees.\n",
      "• Slice in Production (SIP): Once the release is successfully integrated into the MSIT ring, it is moved into the SIP environment, which consists of about 5% worldwide customers who have decided to opt in and are able to provide feedback.\n",
      "Certain types of changes in M365 change management systems are subject to additional review and approval processes dependent on the nature of the change.\n",
      "The four approval levels based on the nature and impact of the change have been included below:\n",
      "• Auto-approval – A set of preapproved, low-risk standard changes.\n",
      "• Functional (Peer) Approval – Standard changes with a slightly higher level of risk.\n",
      "• Change Advisory Board Approval – Changes with the potential for high risk and high impact.\n",
      "• Emergency Change Advisory Board Approval – A risk that must be remediated timely, such as an out of band security patch.\n",
      "M365 service teams use a variety of tools to deploy changes to Azure.\n",
      "The ability to deploy code is restricted to appropriate build deployers using a combination of IDM, Torus, and Lockbox permissions.\n",
      "Security Development Lifecycle\n",
      "M365 environments follow the standard Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) process which includes, at a minimum, risk assessment, testing, approval, and documentation.\n",
      "The SDL process includes security development requirements, which are intended to reduce the number of security-related bugs that appear in the design, code, and documentation associated with a software release, as well as to detect and remove those bugs as early in the SDL as possible.\n",
      "Risk assessment and design review occurs in a Change Advisory Board entitled “Office Hours” whose members formally “Approve” or “Deny” any major or significant change prior to implementation.\n",
      "Members include representatives from Compliance, Security, and Microsoft Legal teams.\n",
      "Testing, including code reviews, occurs during the development and build processes.\n",
      "Results of the tests, reviews, and approvals are tracked through ticketing systems used by each team.\n",
      "These ticketing systems are listed in the Software section above.\n",
      "Data Redundancy\n",
      "Control Objective 3: Data redundancy controls exist to provide reasonable assurance that key information is replicated or backed up and can be restored in a timely manner.\n",
      "Data Replication and Data Redundancy\n",
      "Data for customer content, applications and support services is replicated for redundancy and disaster recovery purposes.\n",
      "M365 applications and supporting services are generally replicated from the primary content database to a secondary content database within the same primary datacenter.\n",
      "The primary and secondary databases are then replicated across geographically dispersed datacenters.\n",
      "Generally, the data maintained in the primary content database is replicated and accessible in real time via: (1) the primary database; (2) a secondary replication database located in the same primary datacenter with real time data; (3) a secondary disaster recovery server with real time replicated data in a geographically segregated datacenter; or (4) a server with a few minutes lag replication in a geographically dispersed datacenter.\n",
      "Data is accessible for redundancy and disaster recovery purposes for applications and support services through the data replication process described above, to meet the SLA requirements.\n",
      "It should be noted that the replication process described above reflects the processes in place for the EXO and SPO systems at an overall level.\n",
      "The supporting service teams perform similar replication processes, such as utilizing an Active-Active (e.g., EOP) replication process, but do not maintain lag copies of data.\n",
      "Azure based services rely on Azure capabilities for geo-redundant replication and storage.\n",
      "Business Continuity\n",
      "The majority of M365 service teams participate in the Enterprise Business Continuity Management (EBCM) program that uses a common set of criteria to determine the relevancy and frequency of failover exercises.\n",
      "Teams not yet integrated into the EBCM process perform periodic failover testing.\n",
      "Where relevant, failover exercises are conducted on a regular basis to test applications and related data to verify the accessibility at a secondary disaster recovery location.\n",
      "The frequency of conducting failover exercises, as well as the recovery time objectives (RTOs) for each application and support service, are based on the nature and criticality of the systems.\n",
      "The RTOs are developed as part of the overall M365 Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Planning.\n",
      "The primary objective of conducting failover exercises is to test whether the RTOs may be met in case of a disaster.\n",
      "Issues identified as part of the failover tests are tracked to ultimate resolution.\n",
      "Customer Termination\n",
      "Customer content is retained after termination of M365 subscriptions per agreed upon commitments with the customer in the contract and SLAs.\n",
      "Customers are responsible for the upload/download and management of data stored within the M365 environments related to confidentiality.\n",
      "Monitoring and Incident Management\n",
      "Control Objective 4: The security of the environment is monitored to provide reasonable assurance that security vulnerabilities are detected and remediated.\n",
      "Vulnerability and Patch Management\n",
      "The M365 Security team monitors for known configuration and patching vulnerabilities through automated scans based on Qualys technology.\n",
      "A master server is configured to scan each server across the M365 applications and supporting services suite to analyze and report known vulnerabilities and patch non-compliance.\n",
      "Each service team reviews the vulnerability scan report from the master server and assesses the criticality of the vulnerabilities and applies patches as applicable.\n",
      "New vulnerabilities (e.g., those from responsible disclosure programs) are communicated to M365 through the Microsoft Security Response Center.\n",
      "If a patch is developed for the vulnerability, each service team evaluates the relevance of the patch to its environment and applies the patch as applicable.\n",
      "Security Incident Monitoring\n",
      "M365 has implemented incident response procedures, which consist of technical mechanisms, organizational infrastructure, and other procedures to detect, respond, and deter security incidents.\n",
      "The M365 incident management technical infrastructure includes monitoring systems for detecting and alerting M365 personnel of security events and incidents.\n",
      "A monitoring agent is installed on each server at the time of server build-out to transfer the security logs to the Security Incident Response (SIR) team, which identifies potential incidents and serves as a central repository for investigations.\n",
      "Incidents posing significant risk to the environment are prioritized for response and mitigation.\n",
      "Additionally, each service team has on-call personnel covering a 24/7 schedule.\n",
      "If an incident is assigned a high enough severity, applicable contingency plans are invoked.\n",
      "When a contingency plan is invoked, the incident manager on shift works with the M365 Security team to implement the contingency plan.\n",
      "Server Build-Out Process\n",
      "M365 has a defined server build-out process to deploy and configure new servers and rebuild existing servers.\n",
      "As part of the server build-out process, each service team performs the following:\n",
      "• Connect the server to the specified domain.\n",
      "• Install antimalware agents to get up to date antimalware signature files and definitions.\n",
      "• Install a server agent to collect server activities and upload the logs to the Security Incident Response (SIR) team databases for security assessment activities.\n",
      "After the base server image is applied and the related build-out process is finished, quality assurance reviews are conducted to validate that the server build-out process completed as expected.\n",
      "The quality assurance review follows a process for server build-out compliance:\n",
      "• Automated build-out tool:\n",
      "Application and supporting service teams that leverage an automated build-out and deployment process utilize a scan performed by the deployment tool to substantiate the build had completed successfully.\n",
      "If there is a failure, the tool attempts to redeploy the build until successful.\n",
      "Certain services leverage Microsoft’s Azure PaaS offerings for server build-out and management.\n",
      "Teams who use Azure IaaS with customized server images maintain, update, and test server images as part of the deployment process.\n",
      "Once the server image has been tested, it is provided to Azure for actual deployment.\n",
      "Control Objectives and Related Control Activities\n",
      "The control objectives and related control activities are documented in Section 4 to reduce the redundancy that would result from listing them in this section and repeating them in Section 4.\n",
      "The control objectives and related control activities are however an integral part of the description of the system.\n",
      "While listed in Section 4, the service organization remains responsible for the representations in the description of controls.\n",
      "These control activities include preventive, detective, and corrective policies and procedures that help M365 identify, decrease, manage, and respond to risk in a timely manner.\n",

      "Internal Audit\n",
      "Microsoft’s IA department provides support to management across the company by independently and objectively analyzing whether the objectives of management are adequately performed, as well as facilitating process improvements and the adoption of business practices, policies, and controls governing worldwide operations.\n",
      "Monitoring of Subservice Organizations\n",
      "M365 uses Microsoft Azure (“Azure”) including the Microsoft Datacenters service, which manages datacenters, IaaS, and PaaS supporting services for the M365 applications including hosting of servers, network support, authentication, virtual server hosting and system data storage.\n",
      "Note that M365 considers Azure and Microsoft Datacenters as two separate organizations within this report and are defined as such.\n",
      "The M365 GRC team is responsible for identifying dependencies of each service and monitoring the organizations’ implementation of agreed-upon security, availability, processing integrity, and confidentiality controls.\n",
      "Dependencies are documented in Inter-Service Agreements.\n",
      "Monitoring includes, but is not limited to, the review of third-party service auditor reports and discussions with subservice organization management.\n",
      "A brief overview of the subservice organizations used by Microsoft 365 is below.\n",
      " | Organization | Brief Description\n",
      " | Microsoft Azure | Microsoft Azure’s cloud Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings are used by M365 to host production data and handle logical access and change management controls for M365.\n",
      " | Microsoft Datacenters | Microsoft Datacenters’ Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offerings are used by M365 to host physical and virtual servers and system data storage.\n",
      "Microsoft Datacenters also handles physical and environmental security controls for M365.\n",
      "\n",
      "System Incidents\n",
      "There were no significant system incidents identified that (a) were the result of controls that were not suitably designed or operating effectively to achieve one or more of the control objectives or (b) otherwise resulted in a significant failure in the achievement of one or more of those control objectives during the period October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024.\n",
      "Significant Changes\n",
      "There were no changes that are likely to affect report users’ understanding of how the system is used to provide the service since the last issued report covering the period ended September 30, 2023.\n",
      "Please see the Software section above for details over the in-scope services.\n",
      "Description of Control Activities\n",
      "Logical Access\n",
      " | Control Objective 1 | Logical access controls exist to provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized access to key systems is restricted.\n",
      " | Change Management Control Objective 2 | Changes to application programs and related data management systems are authorized, tested, documented, approved, and implemented consistent with management’s intentions.\n",
      " | Data Redundancy Control Objective 3 | Data redundancy controls exist to provide reasonable assurance that key information is replicated or backed up and can be restored in a timely manner.\n",

      " | Service Encryption with Customer Key\n",
      " | Control Objective 6 | Controls provide reasonable assurance customer mailboxes are encrypted using customer keys, data that is deleted per request is no longer accessible, and customers data is isolated to those with access to the appropriate customer key.\n",
      "\n",
      "Logical Access\n",
      "Control Objective 1: Logical access controls exist to provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized access to key systems is restricted.\n",
      "Overview Background Checks\n",
      "Backgrounds checks are required and renewed every 2 years for all full-time employees and vendors internationally, as permitted by the laws of each country, before access is granted to certain eligibilities within each workstream.\n",
      "Microsoft full-time employees request background checks, when necessary, through the OSP employee portal.\n",
      "A notification is sent to the requesting employee’s manager for approval.\n",
      "If approved, a notification email is sent to Microsoft HR to process a background check for the requesting employee.\n",
      "When the background check is complete, HR enters the results into SAP.\n",
      "For vendors and contractors, vendor companies are responsible for completing a valid background check for each contracted vendor.\n",
      "Once completed, Microsoft receives an attestation letter from the vendor company confirming the completion and pass status of the vendor’s background check.\n",
      "Once the background check validation is received, Microsoft enters relevant information into SAP through the ECS interface.\n",
      "Background check information for FTEs and vendors is pushed from SAP to an IDM database, after which the IDM tool checks for employee background check information before access to M365 cloud environments can be requested by the employee.\n",
      "Full and incremental sync jobs run to keep the data used by the IDM tool current.\n",
      "Service administrators configure requirements, including background check, for eligibilities within each workstream.\n",
      "If no background check is on file, or if a background check has expired, the user receives an error indicating that the employee does not have required background check, thus preventing the employee or vendor from obtaining those eligibilities.\n",
      "Identity Access Management\n",
      "Microsoft 365 owns and manages tools that regulate access to M365 production environments.\n",
      "Most service teams use the IDM access management service to limit access to authorized users.\n",
      "The service, managed by the Access Control team, allows each of the other service teams to manage their respective AD clusters for their respective environment.\n",
      "Several backend processes synchronize with other internal Microsoft tools, such as Microsoft HR department systems, to check that user information (e.g., employment status, manager, cost center, background check information) meets predefined requirements.\n",
      "Users who meet predefined criteria can request access to certain eligibilities, and access is only granted after approval.\n",
      "Some access is regulated outside the IDM service via other tools and processes; however, the functionality and processes are the same.\n",
      "These tools include IDWeb and OneIdentity.\n",
      "New User or Modification of User Access\n",
      "The process to request and approve new access via access management tools is managed through automated workflows configured within the tools.\n",
      "The systems automatically route access requests to the requestor’s manager for approval.\n",
      "Users who meet specified requirements (e.g. active user, active manager, applicable cost center, or background check) can request specific access to rights within each environment.\n",
      "User requests trigger notifications to the user’s manager via email of a pending access request requiring manager approval.\n",
      "No access is provisioned within production environments until manager approval is obtained.\n",
      "There are certain groups, roles, or entitlements that fall outside the automated provisioning processes described above.\n",
      "In each case users must still submit access requests, and each request must be approved before the access is manually provisioned.\n",
      "External Users (Customer Entities) – When a new customer is added to the M365 service, they are provided with an initial account for system setup.\n",
      "The provisioning of users and deactivation of users is the responsibility of the customer entity.\n",
      "Termination Access Removal\n",
      "When individuals leave the company, Microsoft HR updates the terminated employee’s details in the HR system, which syncs to access management tools via backend tasks.\n",
      "Access for terminated employees is then removed from respective service production environments.\n",
      "Without the appropriate entitlements, the user cannot access services within the M365 environment.\n",
      "Periodic User Access Review\n",
      "Services using the automated access provisioning processes above rely on workflows within the systems to automatically revoke user access based on the following criteria:\n",
      "• Inactivity - after 56 days of inactivity, the user’s account is disabled.\n",
      "• Manager Change - when a user’s manager and/or cost center has changed, users must re-request access using the same process described above, and the new manager must approve the user’s requested access.\n",
      "• Group Pre-defined Expiration - where applicable, services have security groups that have a set expiration period from when an account was granted access to the group.\n",
      "Periodic reviews, both manual and automated, are conducted to verify that each user’s access remains relevant and aligns with their job responsibilities.\n",
      "Some of these reviews use the automated M365 UAR Tool, while others are tracked manually by the services.\n",
      "Just-in-Time Access\n",
      "Just-in-time (JIT) tools allow individuals to request temporary elevated access privileges on an as-needed basis to limited areas within the respective service team’s associated production environments.\n",
      "Each tool follows a similar process before granting temporary elevated access to requesting engineers.\n",
      "Automated configurations within each tool notify the submitting user’s manager with details of the access requested.\n",
      "If approved, the requesting user is granted access on a temporary basis, and the tool automatically removes the requested access based on built-in functionality within the tool.\n",
      "In certain cases, an engineer may receive a one-time preapproval for access elevations to specific areas within an environment; however, the access is still temporary in duration.\n",
      "Additionally, each elevation is logged and retained by the service team for incident evaluations.\n",
      "Developer/Operations Model - Developer Access to Production\n",
      "Using the Access tools described above the service teams have restricted access to appropriate personnel, including the enforcement of segregation between developers and operations personnel.\n",
      "Select service teams allow developers temporary access to production using the JIT tools and approval processes described above.\n",
      "Developer access is limited to specific areas of the environment for deployment or operations purposes.\n",
      "These limitations are enforced using Torus, a Remote PowerShell tool.\n",
      "Torus allows for the restriction of access to specific commands that can be run in the service team’s environment and requires approvals for each command being requested.\n",
      "The Torus request and approval process is managed by the JIT tools described above.\n",
      "For requests to make changes to production code or data by a developer or operator, an associated deployment request ticket must be provided and approved by a separate individual.\n",
      "Authentication\n",
      "Internal users are authenticated using Remote Desktop Services and must be authenticated using a two-factor authentication mechanism that includes a smartcard with PIN to log into the RDG.\n",
      "After logging in to the RDG, the user must enter his/her production account user ID and password to access production servers.\n",
      "The corporate password requirements are defined and configured within code and passwords are automatically generated.\n",
      "These requirements include password complexity, length, history, and duration.\n",
      "Additionally, internal users can gain temporary access to elevated roles allowing access to customer content via the JIT methods described above.\n",
      "For those services that only use JIT elevations to access the environment with no standing access, there are requirements built into the JIT tools for generating onetime complex passwords for authenticating into these environments.\n",
      "External Users – Microsoft provides various options to enable the authentication mechanism for end users and M365 customers.\n",
      "Each external entity is responsible for substantiating that the mechanism is configured and operating, as well as enforcing the use of strong passwords.\n",
      "Data Management Data Segregation\n",
      "Customer content is stored and processed on a shared database which is logically segregated using program logic and a different customer identifier.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox\n",
      "Control Objective 5: Controls provide reasonable assurance that customer content is only accessed when authorized by a designated customer account administrator.\n",
      "For customers utilizing the Customer Lockbox feature, Customer Lockbox is an access control technology included in M365, designed to provide customer control and transparency over access to customer content hosted in Microsoft datacenters.\n",
      "The service grants Microsoft engineers temporary access to customer content on as- needed basis only as approved by an appropriate tenant authority.\n",
      "The following sections, prefixed with “Customer Lockbox,” detail the procedures in place to limit Microsoft access to customer generated content.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Authorization and Notification\n",
      "Access to customer content for customers utilizing the Customer Lockbox feature is initiated through a Service Request made via Microsoft’s customer support.\n",
      "If the Service Request requires access to customer content, the access is requested through the Customer Lockbox tool.\n",
      "Individuals who are approved to access the customer content do so using the Remote PowerShell (RPS) tool.\n",
      "Only Microsoft engineers with appropriate access entitlements within the Exchange environment, can request temporary elevation to the ‘AccessToCustomerData’ role, which allows access to customer content.\n",
      "The request process is built into Customer Lockbox.\n",
      "If approved by the role owners, Microsoft managers, the request is then routed to a customer contact for additional approval.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Customer Approval\n",
      "The automated workflows supporting the Customer Lockbox elevation process require that elevation requests are first approved by Microsoft management before being submitted to a tenant administrator.\n",
      "Tenant administrators are assigned and are the responsibility of each customer.\n",
      "If the request is not approved within a specified period of time by both the Microsoft management and the tenant administrator, then the elevation request times out and becomes invalid.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Associated Service Request\n",
      "Each elevation request made using Customer Lockbox must reference an associated service request number before submission to Microsoft management for approval.\n",
      "Attempts to submit an elevation request without an associated service request number will fail, and the RPS tool will return an error.\n",
      "Service requests are either submitted by the effected customer or created and communicated to the customer prior to the elevation request.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Microsoft 365 Admin Center\n",
      "M365 customers can review a history of Customer Lockbox elevation requests within the customer’s M365 Admin Center.\n",
      "The history includes relevant information for current and past elevation requests, including the date, service request number, duration of elevation, reason for elevation, and requestor.\n",
      "The logs are kept for a reasonable period of time.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Searchable Audit Logs\n",
      "Server activity is logged for each Customer Lockbox elevation, and the activity log repository is available to each Customer Lockbox customer.\n",
      "Activity logs show what actions and commands were executed on a server containing customer content by a Microsoft engineer for the time allowed during an elevation requested through Customer Lockbox.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Management Review of Elevations\n",
      "Microsoft management pulls logs of Customer Lockbox elevations, as well as capacity server administrator elevations, from a data repository and investigates any anomalies.\n",
      "Any anomalies identified are discussed and actioned in a weekly service review.\n",
      "The statistics are aggregated and reviewed annually with Microsoft management.\n",
      "For customers who have chosen to use Customer Lockbox, it is the only way to access customer content.\n",
      "Any other access paths are considered malicious access and are not covered by this attestation.\n",
      "Service Encryption with Customer Key in Microsoft 365\n",
      "Control Objective 6: Controls provide reasonable assurance customer mailboxes are encrypted using customer keys, data that is deleted per request is no longer accessible, and customers data is isolated to those with access to the appropriate customer key.\n",
      "For customers utilizing the Service Encryption with Customer Key feature, Microsoft 365 provides customers with two application level encryption options for their data within Exchange and SharePoint service: 1) Service Encryption with Microsoft owned encryption keys, and 2) Service Encryption with customer-owned keys (“Customer Keys”).\n",
      "In the standard Microsoft Service Encryption described above, M365 owns the encryption keys for the customer’s Exchange mailboxes and SharePoint sites.\n",
      "Service Encryption with Customer Key (“Customer Key”) is an opt-in encryption offering that allows M365 customers to supply and manage their own encryption keys for advanced, self-managed protection.\n",
      "The Customer Key offering is available in both the Exchange Online Worldwide, GCC-M, GCC-H, Department of Defense environment, as well as the SharePoint Online Worldwide environment.\n",
      "Each “Customer Key” subscription a customer maintains has its own service tenant encryption identifier, and two corresponding Azure-hosted customer key vaults.\n",
      "The customer keys are housed in Azure Key Vault; the onboarding process is inclusive of an Azure subscription creation, which customers will then use to house their keys which correspond with their “Customer Key” service.\n",
      "The two respective Azure Key Vaults each maintain a unique encryption key provided by the customer during the “Customer Key” onboarding process.\n",
      "For EXO: The “Customer Key” model can be applied to all users within a customer’s AD environment or can be segregated based on customer preferred user groupings or business unit differentiations.\n",
      "Each respective Exchange “Customer Key” subscription instance maintains its own Data Encryption Policy (“DEP”) that must be configured by the customer admin during the onboarding process as well.\n",
      "Once a DEP has been created, the customer can provision AD user mailboxes to that DEP, applying that encryption policy to the user mailboxes provisioned to that Customer Key DEP.\n",
      "For SPO: The Customer Key model is applied at the tenant level via Tenant Intermediate Keys \"TIKs\"; if a customer opts-in to Customer Key, all SharePoint site instances are encrypted at the application layer.\n",
      "Customer mailboxes or SharePoint sites associated with a Customer Key DEP or TIK are only accessible through utilizing the customer root keys relevant to each encryption policy type, which are stored in Azure Key Vault.\n",
      "Through Azure, Microsoft maintains its own interim keys, but an interim key does not have the ability to decrypt customer data.\n",
      "Under rare circumstances, Microsoft may need to access resources with customer content to perform specific service oriented and maintenance tasks.\n",
      "To do this the service performs a customer key wrap operation, in which Microsoft’s interim key is sent to Azure blob storage to be wrapped with a data blob of the customer key.\n",
      "The Azure key wrap function does not allow Microsoft access to the unique customer root keys themselves; the interim keys are instead wrapped with the root key data for access purposes.\n",
      "Once retrieved, the Microsoft engineer can access resources with customer data to perform the relevant service tasks.\n",
      "Once the tasks are complete, an unwrap operation is performed, in which the wrapped interim key is sent to Azure blob storage to be unwrapped and consequently disassociated from the customer root key housed in Azure Key Vault.\n",
      "Unwrapped interim keys cannot access Customer Key encrypted data.\n",
      "Microsoft provides additional protections if the customer owned root keys are lost or stolen with an “Availability Key”, which provides M365 customers with the capability to recover from the unanticipated loss of root keys.\n",
      "Microsoft will either assist customers through this process or provide customers with instructions on how to recover without assistance from Microsoft.\n",
      "The Availability Key is a root key that is provisioned and protected by Microsoft and is functionally equivalent to the root keys that are supplied by the customer for use with service encryption with “Customer Key.”\n",
      "Because the Availability Key is protected by Microsoft, it uses a different security design and controls from keys that the customer manages.\n",
      "This provides defense-in-depth and protects against the loss of all keys from a single attack or point of failure.\n",
      "Sharing the responsibility to protect the keys, while using a variety of protections and processes for key management, ultimately reduces the risk that all keys will be lost or destroyed.\n",
      "Service Encryption with Customer Key in Microsoft 365 – Termination\n",
      "Customers can opt out of the Service Encryption with Customer Key service.\n",
      "For EXO, customers can revoke root key access, either through group divestiture at a DEP level or through full-service exit.\n",
      "Since the TIK applies to all SharePoint instances, opting out of the Customer Key service consequently applies to all of the tenant’s SharePoint instances.\n",
      "When a tenant wishes to opt-out of the Service Encryption with Customer Key service, the Exchange and SharePoint tenant administrators must confirm that the customer is truly opting out of the service and wants the data to be deleted.\n",
      "Once a customer opts-out of the service, deletes their own root keys, and signs the eDocument stating their service termination, Microsoft locks the customer out of their data as a confirmation step that the tenant would truly like that data to be deleted.\n",
      "Once this step has been taken, the customer’s executive team must formally communicate the opt-out decision on behalf of the customer via signed and notarized documentation.\n",
      "Microsoft will maintain their root key to the customer’s data until the executive confirmation of service termination has been received, or the 90- to 180-day deletion period threshold has been reached.\n",
      "Once the customer service termination confirmation has been communicated, the customer can request that Microsoft delete its root key access to the data in question.\n",
      "Change Management\n",
      "Control Objective 2: Changes to application programs and related data management systems are authorized, tested, documented, approved, and implemented consistent with management’s intentions.\n",
      "Service Infrastructure and Support Systems Change Management\n",
      "Service- and support-related changes follow an established change management process for the M365 environment.\n",
      "Each change is tracked within identified ticketing systems, which contain information that can be linked to approval and testing details related to the change.\n",
      "These ticketing systems are listed in the Software section above.\n",
      "Appropriate authorizations and approvals needed for the changes being made to these environments are defined in the tickets.\n",
      "When service teams or customer representatives enter a request for a change to the M365 environment in the change management systems, a representative of the relevant workstream is charged with addressing the change request.\n",
      "If a code modification is required, the addressor will perform a pull request, which replicates the master branch’s code and allows the user to perform necessary code modifications without disrupting the live code running in production.\n",
      "Each individual change or addition made to address the change request is subject to a peer review in which another workstream representative reviews and approves the individual code changes.\n",
      "Once a change is peer reviewed and approved, it is checked into a build, along with other changes that are currently in the workstream’s deployment process.\n",
      "Each build is subject to security and static analysis testing to test for the presence of security vulnerabilities.\n",
      "Except for in specific scenarios, M365 environment change management processes require 100% testing pass rates prior to moving forward in the deployment process.\n",
      "When a build successfully completes security testing, it is deployed to preproduction environments for integration testing.\n",
      "Builds can be independently deployed to the preproduction environments or multiple builds can be aggregated into a “release,” which is subject to integration testing.\n",
      "Code that has successfully completed all testing types is then deployed to the master code repository and is recognized as the newest version of the workstream’s source code.\n",
      "There are generally three types of preproduction environments, or “rings,” for ring validation integration testing:\n",
      "• DogFood: The workstream’s initial test ring consisting of a subset of Microsoft employees and customers who test changes on Microsoft’s behalf.\n",
      "• MSIT: The MSIT ring allows the release to be subject to testing by all Microsoft employees.\n",
      "• Slice in Production (SIP): Once the release is successfully integrated into the MSIT ring, it is moved into the SIP environment, which consists of about 5% worldwide customers who have decided to opt in and are able to provide feedback.\n",
      "Certain types of changes in M365 change management systems are subject to additional review and approval processes dependent on the nature of the change.\n",
      "The four approval levels based on the nature and impact of the change have been included below:\n",
      "• Auto-approval – A set of preapproved, low-risk standard changes.\n",
      "• Functional (Peer) Approval – Standard changes with a slightly higher level of risk.\n",
      "• Change Advisory Board Approval – Changes with the potential for high risk and high impact.\n",
      "• Emergency Change Advisory Board Approval – A risk that must be remediated timely, such as an out of band security patch.\n",
      "M365 service teams use a variety of tools to deploy changes to Azure.\n",
      "The ability to deploy code is restricted to appropriate build deployers using a combination of IDM, Torus, and Lockbox permissions.\n",
      "Security Development Lifecycle\n",
      "M365 environments follow the standard Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) process which includes, at a minimum, risk assessment, testing, approval, and documentation.\n",
      "The SDL process includes security development requirements, which are intended to reduce the number of security-related bugs that appear in the design, code, and documentation associated with a software release, as well as to detect and remove those bugs as early in the SDL as possible.\n",
      "Risk assessment and design review occurs in a Change Advisory Board entitled “Office Hours” whose members formally “Approve” or “Deny” any major or significant change prior to implementation.\n",
      "Members include representatives from Compliance, Security, and Microsoft Legal teams.\n",
      "Testing, including code reviews, occurs during the development and build processes.\n",
      "Results of the tests, reviews, and approvals are tracked through ticketing systems used by each team.\n",
      "These ticketing systems are listed in the Software section above.\n",
      "Data Redundancy\n",
      "Control Objective 3: Data redundancy controls exist to provide reasonable assurance that key information is replicated or backed up and can be restored in a timely manner.\n",
      "Data Replication and Data Redundancy\n",
      "Data for customer content, applications and support services is replicated for redundancy and disaster recovery purposes.\n",
      "M365 applications and supporting services are generally replicated from the primary content database to a secondary content database within the same primary datacenter.\n",
      "The primary and secondary databases are then replicated across geographically dispersed datacenters.\n",
      "Generally, the data maintained in the primary content database is replicated and accessible in real time via: (1) the primary database; (2) a secondary replication database located in the same primary datacenter with real time data; (3) a secondary disaster recovery server with real time replicated data in a geographically segregated datacenter; or (4) a server with a few minutes lag replication in a geographically dispersed datacenter.\n",
      "Data is accessible for redundancy and disaster recovery purposes for applications and support services through the data replication process described above, to meet the SLA requirements.\n",
      "It should be noted that the replication process described above reflects the processes in place for the EXO and SPO systems at an overall level.\n",
      "The supporting service teams perform similar replication processes, such as utilizing an Active-Active (e.g., EOP) replication process, but do not maintain lag copies of data.\n",
      "Azure based services rely on Azure capabilities for geo-redundant replication and storage.\n",
      "Business Continuity\n",
      "The majority of M365 service teams participate in the Enterprise Business Continuity Management (EBCM) program that uses a common set of criteria to determine the relevancy and frequency of failover exercises.\n",
      "Teams not yet integrated into the EBCM process perform periodic failover testing.\n",
      "Where relevant, failover exercises are conducted on a regular basis to test applications and related data to verify the accessibility at a secondary disaster recovery location.\n",
      "The frequency of conducting failover exercises, as well as the recovery time objectives (RTOs) for each application and support service, are based on the nature and criticality of the systems.\n",
      "The RTOs are developed as part of the overall M365 Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Planning.\n",
      "The primary objective of conducting failover exercises is to test whether the RTOs may be met in case of a disaster.\n",
      "Issues identified as part of the failover tests are tracked to ultimate resolution.\n",
      "Customer Termination\n",
      "Customer content is retained after termination of M365 subscriptions per agreed upon commitments with the customer in the contract and SLAs.\n",
      "Customers are responsible for the upload/download and management of data stored within the M365 environments related to confidentiality.\n",
      "Monitoring and Incident Management\n",

      "Vulnerability and Patch Management\n",
      "The M365 Security team monitors for known configuration and patching vulnerabilities through automated scans based on Qualys technology.\n",
      "A master server is configured to scan each server across the M365 applications and supporting services suite to analyze and report known vulnerabilities and patch non-compliance.\n",
      "Each service team reviews the vulnerability scan report from the master server and assesses the criticality of the vulnerabilities and applies patches as applicable.\n",
      "New vulnerabilities (e.g., those from responsible disclosure programs) are communicated to M365 through the Microsoft Security Response Center.\n",

      "Control Objective 1: Logical access controls exist to provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized access to key systems is restricted.\n",
      "Overview Background Checks\n",
      "Backgrounds checks are required and renewed every 2 years for all full-time employees and vendors internationally, as permitted by the laws of each country, before access is granted to certain eligibilities within each workstream.\n",
      "Microsoft full-time employees request background checks, when necessary, through the OSP employee portal.\n",
      "A notification is sent to the requesting employee’s manager for approval.\n",
      "If approved, a notification email is sent to Microsoft HR to process a background check for the requesting employee.\n",
      "When the background check is complete, HR enters the results into SAP.\n",
      "For vendors and contractors, vendor companies are responsible for completing a valid background check for each contracted vendor.\n",
      "Once completed, Microsoft receives an attestation letter from the vendor company confirming the completion and pass status of the vendor’s background check.\n",
      "Once the background check validation is received, Microsoft enters relevant information into SAP through the ECS interface.\n",
      "Background check information for FTEs and vendors is pushed from SAP to an IDM database, after which the IDM tool checks for employee background check information before access to M365 cloud environments can be requested by the employee.\n",
      "Full and incremental sync jobs run to keep the data used by the IDM tool current.\n",
      "Service administrators configure requirements, including background check, for eligibilities within each workstream.\n",
      "If no background check is on file, or if a background check has expired, the user receives an error indicating that the employee does not have required background check, thus preventing the employee or vendor from obtaining those eligibilities.\n",
      "Identity Access Management\n",
      "Microsoft 365 owns and manages tools that regulate access to M365 production environments.\n",
      "Most service teams use the IDM access management service to limit access to authorized users.\n",
      "The service, managed by the Access Control team, allows each of the other service teams to manage their respective AD clusters for their respective environment.\n",
      "Several backend processes synchronize with other internal Microsoft tools, such as Microsoft HR department systems, to check that user information (e.g., employment status, manager, cost center, background check information) meets predefined requirements.\n",
      "Users who meet predefined criteria can request access to certain eligibilities, and access is only granted after approval.\n",
      "Some access is regulated outside the IDM service via other tools and processes; however, the functionality and processes are the same.\n",
      "These tools include IDWeb and OneIdentity.\n",
      "New User or Modification of User Access\n",
      "The process to request and approve new access via access management tools is managed through automated workflows configured within the tools.\n",
      "The systems automatically route access requests to the requestor’s manager for approval.\n",
      "Users who meet specified requirements (e.g. active user, active manager, applicable cost center, or background check) can request specific access to rights within each environment.\n",
      "User requests trigger notifications to the user’s manager via email of a pending access request requiring manager approval.\n",
      "No access is provisioned within production environments until manager approval is obtained.\n",
      "There are certain groups, roles, or entitlements that fall outside the automated provisioning processes described above.\n",
      "In each case users must still submit access requests, and each request must be approved before the access is manually provisioned.\n",
      "External Users (Customer Entities) – When a new customer is added to the M365 service, they are provided with an initial account for system setup.\n",
      "The provisioning of users and deactivation of users is the responsibility of the customer entity.\n",
      "Termination Access Removal\n",
      "When individuals leave the company, Microsoft HR updates the terminated employee’s details in the HR system, which syncs to access management tools via backend tasks.\n",
      "Access for terminated employees is then removed from respective service production environments.\n",
      "Without the appropriate entitlements, the user cannot access services within the M365 environment.\n",
      "Periodic User Access Review\n",
      "Services using the automated access provisioning processes above rely on workflows within the systems to automatically revoke user access based on the following criteria:\n",
      "• Inactivity - after 56 days of inactivity, the user’s account is disabled.\n",
      "• Manager Change - when a user’s manager and/or cost center has changed, users must re-request access using the same process described above, and the new manager must approve the user’s requested access.\n",
      "• Group Pre-defined Expiration - where applicable, services have security groups that have a set expiration period from when an account was granted access to the group.\n",
      "Periodic reviews, both manual and automated, are conducted to verify that each user’s access remains relevant and aligns with their job responsibilities.\n",
      "Some of these reviews use the automated M365 UAR Tool, while others are tracked manually by the services.\n",
      "Just-in-Time Access\n",
      "Just-in-time (JIT) tools allow individuals to request temporary elevated access privileges on an as-needed basis to limited areas within the respective service team’s associated production environments.\n",
      "Each tool follows a similar process before granting temporary elevated access to requesting engineers.\n",
      "Automated configurations within each tool notify the submitting user’s manager with details of the access requested.\n",
      "If approved, the requesting user is granted access on a temporary basis, and the tool automatically removes the requested access based on built-in functionality within the tool.\n",
      "In certain cases, an engineer may receive a one-time preapproval for access elevations to specific areas within an environment; however, the access is still temporary in duration.\n",
      "Additionally, each elevation is logged and retained by the service team for incident evaluations.\n",
      "Developer/Operations Model - Developer Access to Production\n",
      "Using the Access tools described above the service teams have restricted access to appropriate personnel, including the enforcement of segregation between developers and operations personnel.\n",
      "Select service teams allow developers temporary access to production using the JIT tools and approval processes described above.\n",
      "Developer access is limited to specific areas of the environment for deployment or operations purposes.\n",
      "These limitations are enforced using Torus, a Remote PowerShell tool.\n",
      "Torus allows for the restriction of access to specific commands that can be run in the service team’s environment and requires approvals for each command being requested.\n",
      "The Torus request and approval process is managed by the JIT tools described above.\n",
      "For requests to make changes to production code or data by a developer or operator, an associated deployment request ticket must be provided and approved by a separate individual.\n",
      "Authentication\n",
      "Internal users are authenticated using Remote Desktop Services and must be authenticated using a two-factor authentication mechanism that includes a smartcard with PIN to log into the RDG.\n",
      "After logging in to the RDG, the user must enter his/her production account user ID and password to access production servers.\n",

      "The service grants Microsoft engineers temporary access to customer content on as- needed basis only as approved by an appropriate tenant authority.\n",
      "The following sections, prefixed with “Customer Lockbox,” detail the procedures in place to limit Microsoft access to customer generated content.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Authorization and Notification\n",
      "Access to customer content for customers utilizing the Customer Lockbox feature is initiated through a Service Request made via Microsoft’s customer support.\n",
      "If the Service Request requires access to customer content, the access is requested through the Customer Lockbox tool.\n",
      "Individuals who are approved to access the customer content do so using the Remote PowerShell (RPS) tool.\n",
      "Only Microsoft engineers with appropriate access entitlements within the Exchange environment, can request temporary elevation to the ‘AccessToCustomerData’ role, which allows access to customer content.\n",
      "The request process is built into Customer Lockbox.\n",
      "If approved by the role owners, Microsoft managers, the request is then routed to a customer contact for additional approval.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Customer Approval\n",
      "The automated workflows supporting the Customer Lockbox elevation process require that elevation requests are first approved by Microsoft management before being submitted to a tenant administrator.\n",
      "Tenant administrators are assigned and are the responsibility of each customer.\n",
      "If the request is not approved within a specified period of time by both the Microsoft management and the tenant administrator, then the elevation request times out and becomes invalid.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Associated Service Request\n",
      "Each elevation request made using Customer Lockbox must reference an associated service request number before submission to Microsoft management for approval.\n",
      "Attempts to submit an elevation request without an associated service request number will fail, and the RPS tool will return an error.\n",
      "Service requests are either submitted by the effected customer or created and communicated to the customer prior to the elevation request.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Microsoft 365 Admin Center\n",
      "M365 customers can review a history of Customer Lockbox elevation requests within the customer’s M365 Admin Center.\n",
      "The history includes relevant information for current and past elevation requests, including the date, service request number, duration of elevation, reason for elevation, and requestor.\n",
      "The logs are kept for a reasonable period of time.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Searchable Audit Logs\n",
      "Server activity is logged for each Customer Lockbox elevation, and the activity log repository is available to each Customer Lockbox customer.\n",
      "Activity logs show what actions and commands were executed on a server containing customer content by a Microsoft engineer for the time allowed during an elevation requested through Customer Lockbox.\n",
      "Customer Lockbox - Management Review of Elevations\n",
      "Microsoft management pulls logs of Customer Lockbox elevations, as well as capacity server administrator elevations, from a data repository and investigates any anomalies.\n",

      "Service Encryption with Customer Key in Microsoft 365\n",
      "Control Objective 6: Controls provide reasonable assurance customer mailboxes are encrypted using customer keys, data that is deleted per request is no longer accessible, and customers data is isolated to those with access to the appropriate customer key.\n",
      "For customers utilizing the Service Encryption with Customer Key feature, Microsoft 365 provides customers with two application level encryption options for their data within Exchange and SharePoint service: 1) Service Encryption with Microsoft owned encryption keys, and 2) Service Encryption with customer-owned keys (“Customer Keys”).\n",
      "In the standard Microsoft Service Encryption described above, M365 owns the encryption keys for the customer’s Exchange mailboxes and SharePoint sites.\n",
      "Service Encryption with Customer Key (“Customer Key”) is an opt-in encryption offering that allows M365 customers to supply and manage their own encryption keys for advanced, self-managed protection.\n",
      "The Customer Key offering is available in both the Exchange Online Worldwide, GCC-M, GCC-H, Department of Defense environment, as well as the SharePoint Online Worldwide environment.\n",
      "Each “Customer Key” subscription a customer maintains has its own service tenant encryption identifier, and two corresponding Azure-hosted customer key vaults.\n",
      "The customer keys are housed in Azure Key Vault; the onboarding process is inclusive of an Azure subscription creation, which customers will then use to house their keys which correspond with their “Customer Key” service.\n",
      "The two respective Azure Key Vaults each maintain a unique encryption key provided by the customer during the “Customer Key” onboarding process.\n",
      "For EXO: The “Customer Key” model can be applied to all users within a customer’s AD environment or can be segregated based on customer preferred user groupings or business unit differentiations.\n",
      "Each respective Exchange “Customer Key” subscription instance maintains its own Data Encryption Policy (“DEP”) that must be configured by the customer admin during the onboarding process as well.\n",
      "Once a DEP has been created, the customer can provision AD user mailboxes to that DEP, applying that encryption policy to the user mailboxes provisioned to that Customer Key DEP.\n",
      "For SPO: The Customer Key model is applied at the tenant level via Tenant Intermediate Keys \"TIKs\"; if a customer opts-in to Customer Key, all SharePoint site instances are encrypted at the application layer.\n",
      "Customer mailboxes or SharePoint sites associated with a Customer Key DEP or TIK are only accessible through utilizing the customer root keys relevant to each encryption policy type, which are stored in Azure Key Vault.\n",
      "Through Azure, Microsoft maintains its own interim keys, but an interim key does not have the ability to decrypt customer data.\n",
      "Under rare circumstances, Microsoft may need to access resources with customer content to perform specific service oriented and maintenance tasks.\n",
      "To do this the service performs a customer key wrap operation, in which Microsoft’s interim key is sent to Azure blob storage to be wrapped with a data blob of the customer key.\n",
      "The Azure key wrap function does not allow Microsoft access to the unique customer root keys themselves; the interim keys are instead wrapped with the root key data for access purposes.\n",
      "Once retrieved, the Microsoft engineer can access resources with customer data to perform the relevant service tasks.\n",
      "Once the tasks are complete, an unwrap operation is performed, in which the wrapped interim key is sent to Azure blob storage to be unwrapped and consequently disassociated from the customer root key housed in Azure Key Vault.\n",
      "Unwrapped interim keys cannot access Customer Key encrypted data.\n",
      "Microsoft provides additional protections if the customer owned root keys are lost or stolen with an “Availability Key”, which provides M365 customers with the capability to recover from the unanticipated loss of root keys.\n",
      "Microsoft will either assist customers through this process or provide customers with instructions on how to recover without assistance from Microsoft.\n",
      "The Availability Key is a root key that is provisioned and protected by Microsoft and is functionally equivalent to the root keys that are supplied by the customer for use with service encryption with “Customer Key.”\n",
      "Because the Availability Key is protected by Microsoft, it uses a different security design and controls from keys that the customer manages.\n",
      "This provides defense-in-depth and protects against the loss of all keys from a single attack or point of failure.\n",
      "Sharing the responsibility to protect the keys, while using a variety of protections and processes for key management, ultimately reduces the risk that all keys will be lost or destroyed.\n",
      "Service Encryption with Customer Key in Microsoft 365 – Termination\n",
      "Customers can opt out of the Service Encryption with Customer Key service.\n",
      "For EXO, customers can revoke root key access, either through group divestiture at a DEP level or through full-service exit.\n",
      "Since the TIK applies to all SharePoint instances, opting out of the Customer Key service consequently applies to all of the tenant’s SharePoint instances.\n",
      "When a tenant wishes to opt-out of the Service Encryption with Customer Key service, the Exchange and SharePoint tenant administrators must confirm that the customer is truly opting out of the service and wants the data to be deleted.\n",
      "Once a customer opts-out of the service, deletes their own root keys, and signs the eDocument stating their service termination, Microsoft locks the customer out of their data as a confirmation step that the tenant would truly like that data to be deleted.\n",
      "Once this step has been taken, the customer’s executive team must formally communicate the opt-out decision on behalf of the customer via signed and notarized documentation.\n",
      "Microsoft will maintain their root key to the customer’s data until the executive confirmation of service termination has been received, or the 90- to 180-day deletion period threshold has been reached.\n",
      "Once the customer service termination confirmation has been communicated, the customer can request that Microsoft delete its root key access to the data in question.\n",
      "Change Management\n",
      "Control Objective 2: Changes to application programs and related data management systems are authorized, tested, documented, approved, and implemented consistent with management’s intentions.\n",
      "Service Infrastructure and Support Systems Change Management\n",
      "Service- and support-related changes follow an established change management process for the M365 environment.\n",
      "Each change is tracked within identified ticketing systems, which contain information that can be linked to approval and testing details related to the change.\n",
      "These ticketing systems are listed in the Software section above.\n",
      "Appropriate authorizations and approvals needed for the changes being made to these environments are defined in the tickets.\n",
      "When service teams or customer representatives enter a request for a change to the M365 environment in the change management systems, a representative of the relevant workstream is charged with addressing the change request.\n",
      "If a code modification is required, the addressor will perform a pull request, which replicates the master branch’s code and allows the user to perform necessary code modifications without disrupting the live code running in production.\n",
      "Each individual change or addition made to address the change request is subject to a peer review in which another workstream representative reviews and approves the individual code changes.\n",
      "Once a change is peer reviewed and approved, it is checked into a build, along with other changes that are currently in the workstream’s deployment process.\n",
      "Each build is subject to security and static analysis testing to test for the presence of security vulnerabilities.\n",
      "Except for in specific scenarios, M365 environment change management processes require 100% testing pass rates prior to moving forward in the deployment process.\n",
      "When a build successfully completes security testing, it is deployed to preproduction environments for integration testing.\n",
      "Builds can be independently deployed to the preproduction environments or multiple builds can be aggregated into a “release,” which is subject to integration testing.\n",
      "Code that has successfully completed all testing types is then deployed to the master code repository and is recognized as the newest version of the workstream’s source code.\n",
      "There are generally three types of preproduction environments, or “rings,” for ring validation integration testing:\n",
      "• DogFood: The workstream’s initial test ring consisting of a subset of Microsoft employees and customers who test changes on Microsoft’s behalf.\n",
      "• MSIT: The MSIT ring allows the release to be subject to testing by all Microsoft employees.\n",
      "• Slice in Production (SIP): Once the release is successfully integrated into the MSIT ring, it is moved into the SIP environment, which consists of about 5% worldwide customers who have decided to opt in and are able to provide feedback.\n",
      "Certain types of changes in M365 change management systems are subject to additional review and approval processes dependent on the nature of the change.\n",
      "The four approval levels based on the nature and impact of the change have been included below:\n",
      "• Auto-approval – A set of preapproved, low-risk standard changes.\n",
      "• Functional (Peer) Approval – Standard changes with a slightly higher level of risk.\n",
      "• Change Advisory Board Approval – Changes with the potential for high risk and high impact.\n",
      "• Emergency Change Advisory Board Approval – A risk that must be remediated timely, such as an out of band security patch.\n",
      "M365 service teams use a variety of tools to deploy changes to Azure.\n",
      "The ability to deploy code is restricted to appropriate build deployers using a combination of IDM, Torus, and Lockbox permissions.\n",
      "Security Development Lifecycle\n",
      "M365 environments follow the standard Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) process which includes, at a minimum, risk assessment, testing, approval, and documentation.\n",
      "The SDL process includes security development requirements, which are intended to reduce the number of security-related bugs that appear in the design, code, and documentation associated with a software release, as well as to detect and remove those bugs as early in the SDL as possible.\n",
      "Risk assessment and design review occurs in a Change Advisory Board entitled “Office Hours” whose members formally “Approve” or “Deny” any major or significant change prior to implementation.\n",
      "Members include representatives from Compliance, Security, and Microsoft Legal teams.\n",
      "Testing, including code reviews, occurs during the development and build processes.\n",
      "Results of the tests, reviews, and approvals are tracked through ticketing systems used by each team.\n",
      "These ticketing systems are listed in the Software section above.\n",
      "Data Redundancy\n",
      "Control Objective 3: Data redundancy controls exist to provide reasonable assurance that key information is replicated or backed up and can be restored in a timely manner.\n",
      "Data Replication and Data Redundancy\n",
      "Data for customer content, applications and support services is replicated for redundancy and disaster recovery purposes.\n",
      "M365 applications and supporting services are generally replicated from the primary content database to a secondary content database within the same primary datacenter.\n",
      "The primary and secondary databases are then replicated across geographically dispersed datacenters.\n",
      "Generally, the data maintained in the primary content database is replicated and accessible in real time via: (1) the primary database; (2) a secondary replication database located in the same primary datacenter with real time data; (3) a secondary disaster recovery server with real time replicated data in a geographically segregated datacenter; or (4) a server with a few minutes lag replication in a geographically dispersed datacenter.\n",
      "Data is accessible for redundancy and disaster recovery purposes for applications and support services through the data replication process described above, to meet the SLA requirements.\n",
      "It should be noted that the replication process described above reflects the processes in place for the EXO and SPO systems at an overall level.\n",
      "The supporting service teams perform similar replication processes, such as utilizing an Active-Active (e.g., EOP) replication process, but do not maintain lag copies of data.\n",
      "Azure based services rely on Azure capabilities for geo-redundant replication and storage.\n",
      "Business Continuity\n",
      "The majority of M365 service teams participate in the Enterprise Business Continuity Management (EBCM) program that uses a common set of criteria to determine the relevancy and frequency of failover exercises.\n",
      "Teams not yet integrated into the EBCM process perform periodic failover testing.\n",
      "Where relevant, failover exercises are conducted on a regular basis to test applications and related data to verify the accessibility at a secondary disaster recovery location.\n",
      "The frequency of conducting failover exercises, as well as the recovery time objectives (RTOs) for each application and support service, are based on the nature and criticality of the systems.\n",
      "The RTOs are developed as part of the overall M365 Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Planning.\n",
      "The primary objective of conducting failover exercises is to test whether the RTOs may be met in case of a disaster.\n",
      "Issues identified as part of the failover tests are tracked to ultimate resolution.\n",
      "Customer Termination\n",
      "Customer content is retained after termination of M365 subscriptions per agreed upon commitments with the customer in the contract and SLAs.\n",
      "Customers are responsible for the upload/download and management of data stored within the M365 environments related to confidentiality.\n",
      "Monitoring and Incident Management\n",
      "Control Objective 4: The security of the environment is monitored to provide reasonable assurance that security vulnerabilities are detected and remediated.\n",
      "Vulnerability and Patch Management\n",
      "The M365 Security team monitors for known configuration and patching vulnerabilities through automated scans based on Qualys technology.\n",
      "A master server is configured to scan each server across the M365 applications and supporting services suite to analyze and report known vulnerabilities and patch non-compliance.\n",
      "Each service team reviews the vulnerability scan report from the master server and assesses the criticality of the vulnerabilities and applies patches as applicable.\n",
      "New vulnerabilities (e.g., those from responsible disclosure programs) are communicated to M365 through the Microsoft Security Response Center.\n",
      "If a patch is developed for the vulnerability, each service team evaluates the relevance of the patch to its environment and applies the patch as applicable.\n",
      "Security Incident Monitoring\n",
      "M365 has implemented incident response procedures, which consist of technical mechanisms, organizational infrastructure, and other procedures to detect, respond, and deter security incidents.\n",
      "The M365 incident management technical infrastructure includes monitoring systems for detecting and alerting M365 personnel of security events and incidents.\n",
      "A monitoring agent is installed on each server at the time of server build-out to transfer the security logs to the Security Incident Response (SIR) team, which identifies potential incidents and serves as a central repository for investigations.\n",
      "Incidents posing significant risk to the environment are prioritized for response and mitigation.\n",
      "Additionally, each service team has on-call personnel covering a 24/7 schedule.\n",
      "If an incident is assigned a high enough severity, applicable contingency plans are invoked.\n",
      "When a contingency plan is invoked, the incident manager on shift works with the M365 Security team to implement the contingency plan.\n",
      "Server Build-Out Process\n",
      "M365 has a defined server build-out process to deploy and configure new servers and rebuild existing servers.\n",
      "As part of the server build-out process, each service team performs the following:\n",
      "• Connect the server to the specified domain.\n",
      "• Install antimalware agents to get up to date antimalware signature files and definitions.\n",
      "• Install a server agent to collect server activities and upload the logs to the Security Incident Response (SIR) team databases for security assessment activities.\n",
      "After the base server image is applied and the related build-out process is finished, quality assurance reviews are conducted to validate that the server build-out process completed as expected.\n",
      "The quality assurance review follows a process for server build-out compliance:\n",
      "• Automated build-out tool:\n",
      "Application and supporting service teams that leverage an automated build-out and deployment process utilize a scan performed by the deployment tool to substantiate the build had completed successfully.\n",
      "If there is a failure, the tool attempts to redeploy the build until successful.\n",
      "Certain services leverage Microsoft’s Azure PaaS offerings for server build-out and management.\n",
      "Teams who use Azure IaaS with customized server images maintain, update, and test server images as part of the deployment process.\n",
      "Once the server image has been tested, it is provided to Azure for actual deployment.\n",
      "Control Objectives and Related Control Activities\n",
      "The control objectives and related control activities are documented in Section 4 to reduce the redundancy that would result from listing them in this section and repeating them in Section 4.\n",
      "The control objectives and related control activities are however an integral part of the description of the system.\n",
      "While listed in Section 4, the service organization remains responsible for the representations in the description of controls.\n",

      "Periodic User Access Review\n",
      "Services using the automated access provisioning processes above rely on workflows within the systems to automatically revoke user access based on the following criteria:\n",
      "• Inactivity - after 56 days of inactivity, the user’s account is disabled.\n",
      "• Manager Change - when a user’s manager and/or cost center has changed, users must re-request access using the same process described above, and the new manager must approve the user’s requested access.\n",
      "• Group Pre-defined Expiration - where applicable, services have security groups that have a set expiration period from when an account was granted access to the group.\n",
      "Periodic reviews, both manual and automated, are conducted to verify that each user’s access remains relevant and aligns with their job responsibilities.\n",

      "Automated configurations within each tool notify the submitting user’s manager with details of the access requested.\n",
      "If approved, the requesting user is granted access on a temporary basis, and the tool automatically removes the requested access based on built-in functionality within the tool.\n",
      "In certain cases, an engineer may receive a one-time preapproval for access elevations to specific areas within an environment; however, the access is still temporary in duration.\n",

      "The corporate password requirements are defined and configured within code and passwords are automatically generated.\n",
      "These requirements include password complexity, length, history, and duration.\n",
      "Additionally, internal users can gain temporary access to elevated roles allowing access to customer content via the JIT methods described above.\n",
      "For those services that only use JIT elevations to access the environment with no standing access, there are requirements built into the JIT tools for generating onetime complex passwords for authenticating into these environments.\n",
      "External Users – Microsoft provides various options to enable the authentication mechanism for end users and M365 customers.\n",

      "Appropriate authorizations and approvals needed for the changes being made to these environments are defined in the tickets.\n",
      "When service teams or customer representatives enter a request for a change to the M365 environment in the change management systems, a representative of the relevant workstream is charged with addressing the change request.\n",
      "If a code modification is required, the addressor will perform a pull request, which replicates the master branch’s code and allows the user to perform necessary code modifications without disrupting the live code running in production.\n",
      "Each individual change or addition made to address the change request is subject to a peer review in which another workstream representative reviews and approves the individual code changes.\n",
      "Once a change is peer reviewed and approved, it is checked into a build, along with other changes that are currently in the workstream’s deployment process.\n",
      "Each build is subject to security and static analysis testing to test for the presence of security vulnerabilities.\n",
      "Except for in specific scenarios, M365 environment change management processes require 100% testing pass rates prior to moving forward in the deployment process.\n",
      "When a build successfully completes security testing, it is deployed to preproduction environments for integration testing.\n",
      "Builds can be independently deployed to the preproduction environments or multiple builds can be aggregated into a “release,” which is subject to integration testing.\n",
      "Code that has successfully completed all testing types is then deployed to the master code repository and is recognized as the newest version of the workstream’s source code.\n",
      "There are generally three types of preproduction environments, or “rings,” for ring validation integration testing:\n",
      "• DogFood: The workstream’s initial test ring consisting of a subset of Microsoft employees and customers who test changes on Microsoft’s behalf.\n",
      "• MSIT: The MSIT ring allows the release to be subject to testing by all Microsoft employees.\n",
      "• Slice in Production (SIP): Once the release is successfully integrated into the MSIT ring, it is moved into the SIP environment, which consists of about 5% worldwide customers who have decided to opt in and are able to provide feedback.\n",
      "Certain types of changes in M365 change management systems are subject to additional review and approval processes dependent on the nature of the change.\n",
      "The four approval levels based on the nature and impact of the change have been included below:\n",
      "• Auto-approval – A set of preapproved, low-risk standard changes.\n",
      "• Functional (Peer) Approval – Standard changes with a slightly higher level of risk.\n",
      "• Change Advisory Board Approval – Changes with the potential for high risk and high impact.\n",

      "The SDL process includes security development requirements, which are intended to reduce the number of security-related bugs that appear in the design, code, and documentation associated with a software release, as well as to detect and remove those bugs as early in the SDL as possible.\n",
      "Risk assessment and design review occurs in a Change Advisory Board entitled “Office Hours” whose members formally “Approve” or “Deny” any major or significant change prior to implementation.\n",
      "Members include representatives from Compliance, Security, and Microsoft Legal teams.\n",

      "The primary and secondary databases are then replicated across geographically dispersed datacenters.\n",
      "Generally, the data maintained in the primary content database is replicated and accessible in real time via: (1) the primary database; (2) a secondary replication database located in the same primary datacenter with real time data; (3) a secondary disaster recovery server with real time replicated data in a geographically segregated datacenter; or (4) a server with a few minutes lag replication in a geographically dispersed datacenter.\n",
      "Data is accessible for redundancy and disaster recovery purposes for applications and support services through the data replication process described above, to meet the SLA requirements.\n",
      "It should be noted that the replication process described above reflects the processes in place for the EXO and SPO systems at an overall level.\n",
      "The supporting service teams perform similar replication processes, such as utilizing an Active-Active (e.g., EOP) replication process, but do not maintain lag copies of data.\n",
